# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [7.1.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Create a shared poll in the composer and choose a native poll, custom poll, text version, or post without a poll for each destination. Drafts preserve unfinished choices; publishing requires resolving them.
- Video Editor library with favorites, collections, recent items, saved text styles, effects, animations, transitions, timers and reusable blocks. Saved source files stay available on this device and are copied into the destination project when reused.
- Native countdowns, count-up timers, rings, progress bars, bomb and tomato timers, with editable styling, completion holds and attached countdown sounds.
- Reusable blocks expose text, color and supported hold durations without changing other instances. Repeat places a previewed batch with count, gap and an optional end boundary, with one Undo.
- Open the composed current video frame in Image Editor from the preview controls. Export includes editable chapters generated from named markers and the selected render range.

### Fixed

- Preserve commas in poll answers and show each thread segment's own poll in previews.
- Send LinkedIn poll questions separately from post commentary and use its supported seven-day and fourteen-day duration values.
- Keep poll choices and independent account polls through saving, reopening, copying, and canonical API edits.
- Transitions between text or shapes keep both source images instead of replacing the outgoing image with the incoming one.
- Nested sequences retain their duration in seconds when inserted into a project with a different frame rate.
- Keep saved cloud video assets available after reopening a project instead of asking for local files.
- Prevent the timeline menu from scrolling the editor into an accidental command, and keep short clip bodies available for dragging.
- Refresh paused color comparisons immediately and show caption job progress for the selected clip.
- Show progress and cancellation for cloud project bundle exports, including cancellation of original-media downloads.
- Duplicate Motion layers at their original timing on new tracks and select the copies.
- Open the effect inspector after applying an effect and treat a double-click as one insertion.
- Refresh an imported LUT when its dimensions change, so stale colors cannot survive a dimension mismatch.
- Prevent concurrent welcome confirmations with different keys from creating multiple first Workspaces for one user.
- Published TypeScript SDK 0.3.1 with the stalled-response timeout fix.

### Changed

- Image and Video Editor eyedroppers show a larger pixel grid with a center crosshair and exact color value before selection. The preview stays inside the window near its edges.
- The free image color picker uses the same magnifier for hover and keyboard sampling without changing the selected color on hover.
- Video exports reuse unchanged title, caption, and shape pixels while preserving animation, karaoke timing, and font updates.
- Reuse the Video Editor composition lookup index until the composition registry changes.
- Reduce repeated GPU texture uploads when video and image edits use multiple Curves, LUT, gradient-map, or ASCII effects. Keep texture reuse bounded by count and memory.
- Reuse color-effect buffers during preview and export to reduce per-frame allocations.

### Improved

- Favorites sit in the corner of Video Editor catalog cards, with keyboard access and full-size touch targets.
- Bomb and tomato timers have dimensional shading, detailed materials, animated sparks and completion particles.
- Timer appearance controls include independent colors, progress thickness, segments, rounded ends, ring angle, number visibility and completion effects. Existing font, position, timing and saved-library controls remain available.

### Security

- Stop serving original media, thumbnails, and video posters after access is denied. Previously, error responses could include private file bytes when the media ID was known, even without valid credentials.
- Reject HTML and XML media uploads, including generic MIME declarations and duplicate uploads. Serve existing active documents and unknown file types as downloads with restrictive browser headers. Thanks to Hamza for privately reporting the stored XSS.

## [7.0.1] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- MCP publication variants accept explicit output formats and format locks.
- The composer preserves saved publication alt text and destination-specific media descriptions.
- Composer capability checks include each destination's effective text and attachments.
- Media editing reopens an existing image design, and workspace designs can be deleted from the editor library.
- Source associations are recorded for new editing designs. Older designs remain available and removable; the first Edit after upgrading may create one new design.
- Published records can be removed from OpenPost without deleting posts on social networks.
- Facebook and Instagram image posts no longer inherit Reel settings or reject inline links as unsupported native link settings.
- Failed video encodes release the submitted frame instead of keeping its native video memory open.
- Audio exports no longer reject complete clips or shift their start by one sample when timeline boundaries accumulate floating-point rounding errors.
- Preview sidebars and mobile navigation now follow the selected preview width. Media keeps its natural proportions, attachment collections remain visible, and warnings, polls, thread settings, events, and offers reflect the authored content.
- Composer previews preserve the selected destination format, joined segments, and cleared attachments.
- Guest Image Editor releases local media URLs when their last open view closes, while keeping images available across overlapping views.
- Canceling an Image Editor export also stops archive creation before a download starts. Multi-page previews retain only the previewed page, and export memory checks account for encoded pages and archive buffers.
- Workspace brand controls become available when their data finishes loading after a newly created design opens.
- Meme drafts save before the composer picker closes. Animated memes can return to a publication, and saved meme recipes retain their image slots and source media.
- Self-hosting backup instructions now distinguish the guide's bind mount from the named volume used by the repository Compose file and platform recipes.
- Free text tools now use the same platform character limits and counting rules as the composer. Long drafts also split faster.
- Mobile Video Project uploads now stop when the server rejects the asset upload start, and malformed capture queues remain on-device instead of being treated as empty and overwritten.
- PeerTube video posts now read stored media in bounded chunks during resumable uploads, so publishing works without loading the whole video into memory.
- Provider certification now requires fresh evidence when the required approval tier changes.
- Retrying a publication keeps its original date. A failed finalization returns an error so the job can retry without sending an already published variant again.
- Keep replies typed while an earlier message or engagement reply is sending.
- Clear the selected conversation when message filters change, and stop pending engagement searches from carrying into another Workspace.
- Worker recovery checks the lease again before failing a stale job or marking its provider writes ambiguous. A renewed worker lease keeps the job active.
- The CLI streams media files through upload sessions instead of buffering the full multipart request in memory.
- Documentation link checks now catch links to folders that have no page, while allowing indexless navigation groups.
- Instagram Inbox now checks all permissions Meta requires to read conversations, so accounts missing `pages_manage_metadata` ask to reconnect before message sync.
- Meta publishing failures now report the specific cause and recovery action: expired tokens reconnect, lost Page roles and checkpointed accounts ask for reconnection, policy blocks stay terminal, and transient outages keep retrying. Raw provider error bodies are never retained.
- Keep transform values readable in narrow inspectors and show playback position and total duration in matching frame timecodes.
- Explain canceled or blocked screen sharing without falsely reporting denied camera or microphone access, consistently in the editor and standalone recorder.
- Make Shift-click toggle timeline selection and plain clicks narrow it without breaking group drags. Preserve Motion group spacing and linked source boundaries across repeated drag and trim updates, and keep locked layers selectable.
- Keep Undo, Redo, Save, and Export available after focusing editor controls, while preserving native text editing and local keyboard controls in Video Editor and Quick Cut.
- Recover metadata and binary reads invalidated by concurrent file replacement. Serialize JSON reads with saves, while preserving real permission, corruption, and persistent read errors.
- Free social preview pages keep one page heading while preserving the headings shown inside platform previews.
- Public site builds stay within Cloudflare Pages' header-rule limit while preserving Markdown content types for marketing and documentation.
- The homepage screenshot tour keeps its controls in the initial page layout, avoiding a shift when JavaScript starts.
- Documentation navigation has readable active-link contrast and an accessible GitHub icon.
- Older documentation URLs redirect again after consolidating rules within Cloudflare's limit.
- Sanitize provider transport errors in the X, LinkedIn, PeerTube, Pinterest, and connector HTTP helpers so failing requests no longer leak signed upload or connector URLs into errors and logs.
- SDK request timeouts now include reading response bodies, so a server that sends headers but stalls its body cannot leave calls pending indefinitely.
- TikTok accounts connect with the publishing scopes alone. The profile falls back to the Login Kit identity fields when the Display API username scope is missing, completed Direct Post videos keep the provider publish ID when `video.list` reconciliation is unavailable, and analytics explain the missing Display API scopes instead of blocking the connection.
- Correct the default X Post video limits to 20 minutes / 8 GiB standard and 125 minutes / 16 GiB subscribed, matching X's documented `tweet_video` caps. The previous 512 MiB / 140-second defaults describe Direct Message video, which OpenPost never uploads.

### Changed

- Image Editor pencil strokes process only the affected area, reducing work on large canvases while preserving pressure, texture, selection clipping, and undo.
- Page and template thumbnails grade images at the resolution needed for their crop and size. Interactive editing and exports retain full-resolution pixels.
- Moving, resizing, or changing an image layer's opacity reuses its color grade and blur when their inputs are unchanged.
- Editor operations expose opt-in local Performance traces. Development builds also offer a Svelte DOM update scanner through `renderScan=1`.
- Video exports and composited previews reuse sequential decoding instead of decoding from the previous keyframe for every frame. Reversed clips use bounded frame windows, and finished clips and nested compositions release their decoders.
- Forward video rendering transforms only requested source frames and passes native frames to the compositor, avoiding canvas work for frames skipped by the timeline frame rate or playback speed.
- Reversed clips cache the source frames the timeline will actually display, including speed ramps, reducing repeated decoding within the same memory limit.
- Preview proxies include seek points every quarter second while preserving source frames and timing.
- Full-resolution exports, previews, guides, selections, and page tools use each page's own size. Existing designs keep their current page sizes.
- Page actions remain reachable on narrow phones. Dropping an image onto another page clears the previous selection and fits the new page.
- Image Editor exports package pages and project media without blocking the editor on large ZIP compression or recompressing encoded images and video.
- Image Editor selection moves, paint erasing, and selected-layer color sampling use the affected pixels instead of scanning or reading the full canvas.
- Reworded user-facing copy from Publication to Post and from Rendition to Variant across MCP docs, product copy, marketing, the launch kit, and surface-parity prose. Code identifiers, routes, and API shapes are unchanged. MCP guides now reference the `create_post`, `list_posts`, `get_post`, `update_post`, `set_post_variants`, `reply_to_variant`, `validate_post`, `schedule_post`, `cancel_post`, `publish_post_now`, `list_post_events`, and `list_variant_comments` tools with the `adapt_post_variants` prompt and the `post_id`, `variant_id`, and `variants[]` arguments. Launch-kit samples moved from `docs/launch-kit/renditions/` to `docs/launch-kit/variants/`.
- MCP assistant-facing operations now use post/variant naming: `create_post`, `list_posts`, `get_post`, `update_post`, `set_post_variants`, `reply_to_variant`, `validate_post`, `schedule_post`, `cancel_post`, `publish_post_now`, `list_post_events`, and `list_variant_comments`, plus the `adapt_post_variants` prompt. Argument keys are renamed to match (`post_id`, `variant_id`, `variants`, `failed_variant_count`), and every tool descriptor carries an `idempotentHint` annotation alongside the existing safety hints. The scheduler widget accepts a `variants` view alias.
- Retired `publication_*`/`rendition_*` operation names, the `adapt_platform_renditions` prompt, and the old argument keys remain callable as permanent back-compat aliases (new key wins when both are sent), but are no longer advertised. Structured output keeps the top-level `publication` and `publications` keys. REST paths and bodies, OpenAPI, CLI nouns, database columns, and internal identifiers are unchanged.
- MCP marks every state-changing operation `destructiveHint=true`, keeps `openWorldHint` for operations that reach external provider systems only, and requires a machine-enforceable `confirm=true` second call for `delete_post`, `publish_post_now`, `delete_media`, and `delete_comment`.
- MCP `list_posts` constrains `status` and `content_profile` to enums so typos fail with `-32602`, and `create_post` documents that `scheduled_at` only stores a desired time while `schedule_post` validates and enqueues.
- MCP `render_local_media_upload` is read-only end to end: it needs only workspace read access and stays visible to `mcp:read` connections, while the upload-ticket tool remains `mcp:full` only.
- MCP read paging is now consistent: `list_posts` and `list_media` default to 20 and cap at 100, while `list_post_events` is explicitly 100/200.
- MCP provider catalog, social account, and readiness descriptions name each other as next steps; `list_posts` and `validate_post` failure text names `get_post` for delivery detail and `retry_failed_variants` for safe retries.
- MCP clarifies widget renderer scope: both render tools are read-only and visible to `mcp:read`, while the upload ticket tool stays app-only and requires `mcp:full`.
- MCP OAuth has no per-client allow-listing: any standards-compliant OAuth client can connect, and the recorded client name is attribution only.
- Marketing feature screenshots load sizes suited to the visitor's screen.
- Documentation search loads when opened, reducing the JavaScript needed for an initial page view.

### Added

- Pinterest, Reddit, and Google Business Profile post previews, plus dedicated page layouts for every preview platform.
- Free platform-specific post preview tools with card and full-page views, phone, tablet, and desktop widths, and light and dark appearances.
- Live compact previews in the publication composer, with a full-page preview that follows edits.
- Image Editor pages can have different canvas sizes within one design. Resize the active page with Fit, Fill, Keep size, or Stretch, and see each page's size in the page strip.
- Save workspace layer-effect presets with blend modes, shadows, and outlines. Apply a preset with one undo step, update it from a layer, or delete it without changing layers that already use it.
- Select part of a text layer in the Image Editor canvas or Text field to set its weight, italic style, underline, or color without changing the rest of the layer. Emphasis survives text edits, undo, saved designs, portable projects, and image export.
- Screenshot templates for messages, group chats, receipts, and status pages. Edit structured fields with a live preview, undo and redo, light or dark artwork, and automatic image height or fixed social shapes.
- Workspace designs with automatic saving and conflict protection. Download PNGs, save editable exports to Media, or return them to a publication without losing the composer draft.
- Image messages and profile photos for every chat participant. Choose, replace, or remove photos from Media, preserve them in saved designs and PNGs, and retain source images for editable exports.
- Memes now appear in Templates and use the same saved workspace drafts, undo and redo, image picker, and export controls as chats, receipts, and status pages. Existing memes can be reopened as editable copies from Media.
- Instagram and YouTube posts can now publish a first comment as a child operation of the same publish flow.
- Facebook link posts retry without the link-card attachment when the provider rejects the scrape, and LinkedIn link posts resolve their preview the same way, so link shares degrade to text posts instead of failing.
- Add a gated Google Business Profile provider (`googlebusiness`) for controlled development and certification: OAuth connection with location selection, STANDARD/EVENT/OFFER local post validation, and create-then-reconcile publishing. Delivery stays disabled until Google API access and live certification are complete.
- MCP `list_publications` now pages with an opaque `cursor` input and `has_more`, `next_cursor`, and `total_count` outputs, defaulting to 20 items per response and capping at 100. Assistants review large queues by following `next_cursor` over narrow windows instead of requesting wide unbounded windows.
- MCP `list_publications` items now include a safe failure summary: `failed_rendition_count` plus the curated `error_kind`, `error_action`, and `error_message` of the first failed destination. Raw provider response bodies are never exposed.
- MCP execute-mode mutations accept an optional `idempotency_key` routed into the existing REST idempotency path, so retried `create_post`, `update_post`, `set_post_variants`, `schedule_post`, `cancel_post`, `publish_post_now`, `reply_to_variant`, comment actions, `upload_media_from_url`, and upload-ticket calls replay the stored result instead of running twice.
- MCP can now delete posts through `delete_post` (post ID plus expected revision with a `confirm=true` second call), manage media through `get_media`, `update_media` (favorite, alt text), and `delete_media` (with `confirm=true`), and retry delivery through `retry_failed_variants` and `retry_variant` using the post-action shape.
- MCP `schedule_post` and `publish_post_now` accept `dry_run` to validate readiness without enqueueing, and post results accept `detail: summary|full` to choose between the unified summary plus job ID shape and the complete post.
- MCP comment mutations now report `job_id` instead of `id`, and every post mutation returns the unified summary plus job ID shape.
- MCP `list_media` and `list_post_events` now page with an opaque `cursor` input and `has_more`, `next_cursor`, and `total_count` outputs, using the same shape as `list_posts`. Events default to 100 items per response and cap at 200.
- MCP `list_variant_comments` accepts a `limit` input (1-100, default 50); results beyond the limit are truncated in provider order and the response text notes the truncation.
- MCP `get_post_metrics` returns stored analytics per variant (normalized `views`, `reactions`, `engagements`, `impressions`, and `reach`) plus post totals, reading stored snapshots without provider calls.
- MCP `get_dashboard_link` builds an app-origin dashboard URL for `post`, `media`, `account`, and `calendar` views so agents can hand users a link to the visualization.
- MCP `search_docs` searches a curated offline registry of documentation and assistant skill pages, returning titles, `/docs` paths, and snippets.
- MCP documents recommended toolsets per client (direct `/mcp` for full-catalog clients, compact `/mcp/code` for constrained ones) and records the accepted gaps: no account connect/disconnect, no bulk operations, and no webhook tools.
- Native post imports as a separate opt-in library, independent of Analytics. Enabling imports on a Bluesky or Mastodon account stores its native posts (published after opt-in only, never backfilled) in a read-only imported-posts library with per-account checkpoints, daily read budgets, and loop protection against posts published through OpenPost. X native reads stay disabled by the read-cost policy; Threads, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, and Pinterest are explicit TODOs.
- TikTok authorization is now capability-driven: the login request asks for the publishing scopes (`user.info.basic`, `video.publish`, `video.upload`) plus the optional Display API scopes (`user.info.profile`, `user.info.stats`, `video.list`). Set `OPENPOST_DISABLE_TIKTOK_DISPLAY_API=true` when the TikTok app has no Display API approval so the request asks only for what TikTok can grant.

### Improved

- Browse free tools in a searchable grid with editor screenshots, image examples, network icons, and compact phone layouts.
- Devenv shell entry no longer waits for another worktree's active Turbo task before starting commands. Explicit `cache-prune` still waits to enforce the cache limit.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- Image Editor pencil strokes process only the affected area, reducing work on large canvases while preserving pressure, texture, selection clipping, and undo.
- Page and template thumbnails grade images at the resolution needed for their crop and size. Interactive editing and exports retain full-resolution pixels.

Launch-kit samples moved from `docs/launch-kit/renditions/` to `docs/launch-kit/variants/`.
- MCP assistant-facing operations now use post/variant naming: `create_post`, `list_posts`, `get_post`, `update_post`, `set_post_variants`, `reply_to_variant`, `validate_post`, `schedule_post`, `cancel_post`, `publish_post_now`, `list_post_events`, and `list_variant_comments`, plus the `adapt_post_variants` prompt. Argument keys are renamed to match (`post_id`, `variant_id`, `variants`, `failed_variant_count`), and every tool descriptor carries an `idempotentHint` annotation alongside the existing safety hints.

### Fixed

- Exposed the Video Editor background browser as a named group so its accessible label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Exposed the Video Editor bento layout preset picker as a named group so its accessible label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Count Bluesky post text in grapheme clusters, the unit of its 300-character limit, in both publishing validation and the composer counter. Emoji with skin tones, flags and ZWJ sequences were counted as two to seven characters each, so posts Bluesky accepts were rejected as over the limit.
- Month-grid publication buttons now include the destination account count in their accessible name (for example "Launch week post · 2 accounts") instead of only the post title. The avatar stack inside the button is decorative and hidden from assistive technology.
- Day-drawer publication rows now expose the account count as screen-reader text instead of an `aria-label` on a role-less span, which assistive technology silently ignored.
- Expose the Video Editor caption preset picker as a named group so its accessible label reaches assistive technology.
- Exposed the Video Editor clip properties container as a named group so its accessible label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Gave the timeline clip volume slider PageUp/PageDown keyboard support: PageUp raises and PageDown lowers the clip volume by six decibels, matching the audio mixer fader large-step convention alongside the existing arrow, Home, and End keys.
- Exposed the Video Editor color presets picker as a named group so its accessible label reaches assistive technology.
- Gave the editor color wheel slider full WAI-ARIA keyboard support: PageUp and PageDown now move the value in large steps (ten times the arrow-key step), completing the Home/End support it already had and matching the shared knob control.
- Restored the composer's "Workspace changed" confirmation after discard-and-switch: the notice now survives the app-shell reload that workspace switches trigger, so scheduling/attachment resets are announced instead of silently dropped.
- Re-enabled the skipped `an in-flight autosave cannot attach an old-workspace draft after switching` E2E, which proves the notice appears, the late first-workspace save never attaches to the URL, and follow-up typing saves into the new workspace.
- Video Editor composition control override fields now expose the control name as an explicit accessible name, instead of relying on the default-value placeholder alone so screen-reader users keep the label while typing.
- Exposed the Video Editor composition work-area lane as a named group so its timeline-range label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Exposed the Video Editor composition layer sidebar as a named group so its layers label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Exposed the Video Editor composition dimensions strip as a named group so its "Composition dimensions" label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Gave the Video Editor composition timeline layer-tools container an explicit `toolbar` role so its "Layer tools" label is exposed to assistive technology instead of being silently ignored on a role-less `div`.
- Video Editor on-canvas crop handles now support PageUp/PageDown large steps and Home/End bound jumps, completing their WAI-ARIA slider keyboard contract alongside the existing arrow and shift-arrow nudges.
- Gave Video Editor curves points full WAI-ARIA slider keyboard support: PageUp and PageDown move the output in large steps, Home jumps to minimum output, and End jumps to maximum output, matching the shared knob and color wheel controls.
- Expose the workspace and organization delete dialog loading indicators as live statuses so their "Loading..." label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored on a role-less container.
- Video Editor scene browser and keyboard shortcut search fields now expose an explicit accessible name, instead of relying on the placeholder alone so screen-reader users keep the label while typing.
- Exposed the Video Editor effect browser as a named group so its Effects label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored on a role-less container.
- The Video Editor effects panel "Modified from defaults" indicator now exposes its label through `role="img"`. The label was previously set on a role-less wrapper around an aria-hidden dot, so assistive technology silently ignored it and a tweaked effect was announced without its modified state.
- Exposed the Video Editor expression dimensions strip as a named group so its accessible label reaches assistive technology.
- Video Editor fade handles and audio fade curve dots now support PageUp and PageDown: fade durations jump one second, curve dots move ten arrow steps, matching the knob, color wheel, curves, ruler, and mini-timeline sliders.
- Expose the Grow profile card follower counts and reason chips as named groups so their accessible labels reach assistive technology.
- Gave the Video Editor qualifier hue-band slider full WAI-ARIA keyboard support: PageUp/PageDown now move the key hue in large steps, alongside the existing arrow small steps and Home/End jumps.
- Inbox reply composers in messages and engagement now expose an explicit accessible name, instead of relying on the placeholder alone so screen-reader users keep the label while typing.
- Instagram Inbox now checks all permissions Meta requires to read conversations, so accounts missing `pages_manage_metadata` ask to reconnect before message sync.
- Exposed the instance configuration section switcher as a named "Configuration sections" group so assistive technology announces the section buttons together instead of silently ignoring the label.
- The Video Editor keyframe graph's bezier easing handles and playhead scrub line no longer claim the keyboard-operable `slider` role. They are pointer-only affordances (`tabindex="-1"`, no keyboard handler) that keyboard users could never reach or adjust, so screen readers announced phantom sliders. They now expose `role="img"` with their existing labels. Easing stays keyboard-adjustable through the focusable segment easing buttons and preset menu, and playhead position stays available through the timeline ruler and mini-timeline sliders.
- The editor knob slider now supports Home, End, PageUp, and PageDown keys per the WAI-ARIA slider pattern: Home jumps to the minimum, End jumps to the maximum, and PageUp/PageDown move in large ten-step increments. Arrow keys, double-click reset, and the disabled state are unchanged.
- Gave the Video Editor layer type badge `role="img"` so its full type name reaches assistive technology. The single-letter badge (T/S/C/…) now exposes the item type (e.g. "text") instead of being silently ignored on a role-less `span`.
- Exposed the Video Editor linked A/V drift badge as a labeled image so its "Linked clips are out of sync by ..." description reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored on a role-less span.
- Exposed loading indicators as live statuses so assistive technology announces them: meme generator candidate and template skeleton grids, sidebar drafts loading skeletons, and theme preview loading state.
- The login verification code button now stays disabled until a full six-digit authenticator code is entered, instead of letting incomplete codes be submitted for a round-trip that always fails.
- Exposed the Video Editor Lottie browser as a named group so its LottieFiles label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored on a role-less container.
- The landing-page screenshot zoom now shows the dark variant when the site is in dark mode. The enlarged clone lives outside the `<picture>` element, so the composer screenshot (the only tour view with responsive variants) fell back to its light `srcset` while enlarged.
- Accept `.ogg`, `.oga`, `.opus` and `.m4a` uploads again. The content sniffer names Ogg `application/ogg` and every ISO BMFF brand `video/mp4`, so files browsers declare as `audio/ogg`, `video/ogg` or `audio/x-m4a` were rejected as not matching their declared MIME type.
- Store an Ogg upload with the `audio/ogg` or `video/ogg` type the browser declared instead of the sniffer's `application/ogg`, so it is presented as audio or analysed as video rather than filed as an unknown file.
- Store an M4A upload with the `audio/x-m4a`, `audio/m4a` or `audio/mp4` type the browser declared instead of the sniffer's `video/mp4`, so it is presented as audio rather than analysed as video.
- The media library video-processing indicator is now exposed as a named progress bar with its current percent value, so assistive technology users get programmatic progress semantics (previously a plain visual bar) alongside the existing polite live-region status text.
- Media search fields in the library page and the media picker now expose an explicit accessible name, instead of relying on the placeholder alone so screen-reader users keep the label while typing.
- Exposed the media picker source switcher (Library, Device, Camera, and creation actions) as a named group so assistive technology announces its "Source" label instead of silently ignoring it.
- Named the media picker source tablist (Library, Device, Camera) with its "Source" label so assistive technology announces the tab container as well as the surrounding group.
- Gave the media tag filter button group an explicit `group` role so screen readers announce the "Filter media by tag" label that was previously attached to a role-less container and ignored by assistive technology.
- Exposed the media picker type filter ("All", "Images", "Videos") as a named group so assistive technology announces the filter purpose instead of silently dropping its label.
- Exposed the media upload dialog source switcher as a named group so its "Source" label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored on a role-less container.
- Exposed the media upload "Uploaded" success badge to assistive technology as a labeled image instead of a silently ignored label on a role-less element.
- Give media library video poster thumbnails the same accessible name as image thumbnails (`alt_text`, falling back to the file name), so video posters are announced to assistive technology instead of being silently decorative.
- Meta publishing failures now report the specific cause and recovery action: expired tokens reconnect, lost Page roles and checkpointed accounts ask for reconnection, policy blocks stay terminal, and transient outages keep retrying. Raw provider error bodies are never retained.
- Gave the Video Editor Color mini-timeline slider full WAI-ARIA keyboard support: PageUp and PageDown now jump one second of frames, alongside the existing arrow (1/10 frames) and Home/End behavior.
- The Video Editor on-canvas position motion path now exposes its "Position motion path" label through `role="group"`. The label was previously set on the wrapping `<svg>` without a role, so assistive technology silently ignored it and the motion keyframe controls were announced without their path context.
- Named the Video Editor keyframe view switcher (Dope Sheet / Graph) and the speech cleanup mode switcher (filler words / silent sections) tablists so assistive technology announces each tab container instead of presenting unnamed tabs.
- Hid the sidebar notification unread-count badge from assistive technology instead of giving it an ignored label: the badge sits inside an already-named Notifications link whose label announces the count, matching the compact bell pattern.
- Keep transform values readable in narrow inspectors and show playback position and total duration in matching frame timecodes.
- Explain canceled or blocked screen sharing without falsely reporting denied camera or microphone access, consistently in the editor and standalone recorder.
- Make Shift-click toggle timeline selection and plain clicks narrow it without breaking group drags. Preserve Motion group spacing and linked source boundaries across repeated drag and trim updates, and keep locked layers selectable.
- Keep Undo, Redo, Save, and Export available after focusing editor controls, while preserving native text editing and local keyboard controls in Video Editor and Quick Cut.
- Recover metadata and binary reads invalidated by concurrent file replacement. Serialize JSON reads with saves, while preserving real permission, corruption, and persistent read errors.
- Repaired the `lint:oxlint` gate, which was failing on 24 anti-slop errors across 11 browser regression test files. Every `as` assertion now carries a `SAFETY:` comment stating the checked invariant, the four render-helper `Record<string, unknown>` props are typed as owner-derived `Partial<ComponentProps<typeof ...>>`, and the curves `middleOutput` helper takes the typed mock-call tuple instead of `unknown`.
- Exposed the paused-connection indicator dot on inactive social accounts as a labeled image so its "Connection paused" description reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored on a role-less span.
- The homepage screenshot tour keeps its controls in the initial page layout, avoiding a shift when JavaScript starts.
- Documentation navigation has readable active-link contrast and an accessible GitHub icon.
- Older documentation URLs redirect again after consolidating rules within Cloudflare's limit.
- The Quick Cut editor header back button now announces "Back" instead of the application title, so assistive technology describes the control's action (return to the project start screen, confirming first when unsaved local work would be discarded) instead of mislabeling it. This matches the image-editor back button pattern.
- Closing a local Quick Cut project without a workspace folder now asks for confirmation through the themed in-app destructive dialog instead of the browser-native `window.confirm` prompt, matching the source-removal flow on the same page.
- Exposed the failed-posts recovery queue on Publications as a named group so its "Publication recovery queue" label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Token refresh jobs now fail loudly with a recorded error when the token manager is not configured, instead of being marked completed without attempting a refresh. Expired credentials now surface in job history and telemetry rather than only as downstream publishing auth errors.
- Sanitize provider transport errors in the X, LinkedIn, PeerTube, Pinterest, and connector HTTP helpers so failing requests no longer leak signed upload or connector URLs into errors and logs.
- Exposed the Video Editor scene browser library-color swatches as a named group so the "Library colors" label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Exposed the Video Editor scene match signals as a named group so their label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Exposed the Video Editor scope view-mode switcher (RGB/R/G/B/Y) as a named group so its "Live color scope" label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Exposed the Video Editor shape browser as a named group so its accessible label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Removed the overriding accessible name on the shape mask path hint so screen readers announce its visible "Mask type" label instead of replacing it with the tooltip text. The editing hint remains available as a hover tooltip.
- Gave the keyboard shortcut filter bar its own "Filter shortcuts" accessible name and group role instead of reusing the "All" filter label, so screen-reader users hear what the control filters rather than a duplicate of the first option.
- The Video Editor track-height resize sliders now announce e.g. "96 pixels" instead of a bare number, and the Color before/after split slider announces e.g. "50%" instead of a bare number. These were the last two editor sliders with unit-less screen-reader announcements.
- Gave the Video Editor source audio waveform slider PageUp/PageDown keyboard support for ten-second seeks, matching the arrow-key small steps and Home/End jumps.
- Announced the source audio waveform slider position as formatted time (for example `0:50.0`, or `1:02:05.5` past an hour) through `aria-valuetext`, instead of exposing only raw seconds to assistive technology. The text comes from a new `formatSourceWaveformTime` helper beside the existing waveform seek math and updates as the playhead moves.
- Video Editor Color before/after split slider now supports PageUp and PageDown ten-percent jumps, completing its WAI-ARIA keyboard contract alongside the existing arrow, shift-arrow, Home, and End gestures.
- Exposed the Video Editor sticker browser as a named group so its Stickers label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored on a role-less container.
- Exposed the Video Editor stock browser as a named group so its Stock label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Repaired the `svelte-check` gate: fixed five type errors in browser regression tests (missing default test-fixture argument, Playwright `Locator` has no `.locator()` method so scope with `getByTestId`, and the spied OpenAPI `GET` options parameter resolving to `never`).
- Gave the media tag picker's new-tag field and the destination/effect option search fields explicit accessible names matching their visible placeholder text, so screen-reader users keep the label while typing.
- Exposed the Video Editor text style presets and text effects pickers as named groups so their labels reach assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Exposed the Video Editor text template browser as a named group so its Templates label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Re-enabled the skipped theme color-randomization regression test now that the randomizer only commits contrast-safe palettes, and extended it with notebook seeds that fail without the guard, so Randomize can no longer produce a draft the validator rejects.
- Announced theme validation issues as an alert so assistive technology reports the named "Validation issues" error list instead of silently ignoring it.
- TikTok accounts connect with the publishing scopes alone. The profile falls back to the Login Kit identity fields when the Display API username scope is missing, completed Direct Post videos keep the provider publish ID when `video.list` reconciliation is unavailable, and analytics explain the missing Display API scopes instead of blocking the connection.
- Gave the Video Editor timeline ruler (the playhead `slider`) full WAI-ARIA keyboard support: `PageUp`/`PageDown` now jump one second of frames forward/back, matching the large-step keys added to the knob, color wheel, and curves-point sliders. Arrow keys (one frame, ten with shift) and Home/End behavior are unchanged.
- Announced the Video Editor timeline ruler playhead position as a timecode (for example `00:00:03:00`) through `aria-valuetext`, instead of exposing only the raw frame number to assistive technology. The text follows the same `formatTimelinePreviewTimecode` helper already used by the Color mini-timeline playhead and marker labels, and updates live while seeking.
- The shared editor toolbar group only claims the `toolbar` landmark role when it is given an accessible name. The two unnamed groups (Quick Cut timeline controls and the keyframe sheet clipboard buttons) previously announced themselves as a bare "toolbar" with no way for screen-reader users to tell them apart from sibling toolbars; they now render as plain containers while their individually labeled buttons are unchanged.
- The Video Editor timeline track-height resize handles now support PageUp and PageDown for large 24px height jumps, matching the large-step convention of the other editor sliders. Arrow keys, shift-modified arrows, Home, and End behavior is unchanged.
- Exposed the Video Editor transition browser as a named group so its accessible label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Exposed the Video Editor transport timecode readout as a labeled image so its "timecode / total frames" label reaches assistive technology instead of being silently ignored.
- Re-enabled the skipped workspace-switcher race test proving a slow previous-workspace accounts response cannot replace the newly selected workspace's account data. It passes with no code changes: the earlier workspace-selection fixes plus per-workspace query keys already isolate the late response.
- Fixed workspace creation silently keeping the old workspace when the create dialog remounts mid-flight. Selection of the just-created workspace now survives dialog unmount instead of aborting with no error.
- Deleting the active workspace from workspace settings now navigates back to the home page as intended. Previously the deletion succeeded and the store switched to another workspace, but the page stayed on the settings URL of the deleted workspace: shrinking the workspace list flips the layout's workspace access key, which remounts the settings page through its onboarding loading gate mid-flight and invalidates the delete handler's still-current guard, so the post-delete navigation never ran. The handler now also navigates when the (possibly remounted) page still shows the deleted workspace.
- Fixed workspace creation silently keeping the old workspace when a background refresh (such as the layout onboarding check) resolves after the new selection is applied. Implicit refreshes no longer move a selection that is newer than their own intent; they refresh the workspace inventory and keep the current workspace.
- Correct the default X Post video limits to 20 minutes / 8 GiB standard and 125 minutes / 16 GiB subscribed, matching X's documented `tweet_video` caps. The previous 512 MiB / 140-second defaults describe Direct Message video, which OpenPost never uploads.

### Added

- Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Facebook posts can now publish a first comment as a child operation of the same publish flow.
- Facebook link posts retry without the link-card attachment when the provider rejects the scrape, and LinkedIn link posts resolve their preview the same way, so link shares degrade to text posts instead of failing.
- Add a gated Google Business Profile provider (`googlebusiness`) for controlled development and certification: OAuth connection with location selection, STANDARD/EVENT/OFFER local post validation, and create-then-reconcile publishing. Delivery stays disabled until Google API access and live certification are complete.
- MCP `list_posts` now pages with an opaque `cursor` input and `has_more`, `next_cursor`, and `total_count` outputs, defaulting to 20 items per response and capping at 100. Assistants review large queues by following `next_cursor` over narrow windows instead of requesting wide unbounded windows.
- MCP `list_posts` items now include a safe failure summary: `failed_variant_count` plus the curated `error_kind`, `error_action`, and `error_message` of the first failed destination. Raw provider response bodies are never exposed.
- MCP execute-mode mutations accept an optional `idempotency_key` routed into the existing REST idempotency path, so retried `create_post`, `update_post`, `set_post_variants`, `schedule_post`, `cancel_post`, `publish_post_now`, `reply_to_variant`, comment actions, `upload_media_from_url`, and upload-ticket calls replay the stored result instead of running twice.
- MCP can now delete posts through `delete_post` (post ID plus expected revision with a `confirm=true` second call), manage media through `get_media`, `update_media` (favorite, alt text), and `delete_media` (with `confirm=true`), and retry delivery through `retry_failed_variants` and `retry_variant` using the post-action shape.
- MCP `schedule_post` and `publish_post_now` accept `dry_run` to validate readiness without enqueueing, and post results accept `detail: summary|full` to choose between the unified summary plus job ID shape and the complete post.
- MCP comment mutations now report `job_id` instead of `id`, and every post mutation returns the unified summary plus job ID shape.
- MCP `list_media` and `list_post_events` now page with an opaque `cursor` input and `has_more`, `next_cursor`, and `total_count` outputs, using the same shape as `list_posts`. Events default to 100 items per response and cap at 200.
- MCP `list_variant_comments` accepts a `limit` input (1-100, default 50); results beyond the limit are truncated in provider order and the response text notes the truncation.
- MCP `get_post_metrics` returns stored analytics per variant (normalized `views`, `reactions`, `engagements`, `impressions`, and `reach`) plus post totals, reading stored snapshots without provider calls.
- MCP `get_dashboard_link` builds an app-origin dashboard URL for `post`, `media`, `account`, and `calendar` views so agents can hand users a link to the visualization.
- MCP `search_docs` searches a curated offline registry of documentation and assistant skill pages, returning titles, `/docs` paths, and snippets.
- MCP documents recommended toolsets per client (direct `/mcp` for full-catalog clients, compact `/mcp/code` for constrained ones) and records the accepted gaps: no account connect/disconnect, no bulk operations, and no webhook tools.
- Native post imports as a separate opt-in library, independent of Analytics. Enabling imports on a Bluesky or Mastodon account stores its native posts (published after opt-in only, never backfilled) in a read-only imported-posts library with per-account checkpoints, daily read budgets, and loop protection against posts published through OpenPost. X native reads stay disabled by the read-cost policy; Threads, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, and Pinterest are explicit TODOs.
- TikTok authorization is now capability-driven: the login request asks for the publishing scopes (`user.info.basic`, `video.publish`, `video.upload`) plus the optional Display API scopes (`user.info.profile`, `user.info.stats`, `video.list`). Set `OPENPOST_DISABLE_TIKTOK_DISPLAY_API=true` when the TikTok app has no Display API approval so the request asks only for what TikTok can grant.

## [6.2.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Composer destination tabs now mark accounts that carry their own custom content with a small dot, so unsynced tabs stand apart from tabs sharing the common draft. The marker keeps its own accessible label and sits beside the existing issue count.

### Removed

- Removed the standalone Editors catalog page (`/editors`). Image and video work now starts from the Media library and the editor start pages, and every editor header leads back into OpenPost: the shared editor headers return to OpenPost home, and the Image Editor returns to Media. The Editors entry is gone from workspace navigation.

## [6.1.8] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Workspace-scoped `api:read` tokens can now call the stored analytics overview (`GET /api/v1/analytics`). The operation was missing from the read automation catalogue, so valid read-only tokens received `403`.
- Admitted the same class of stored-data workspace reads to the `api:read` catalogue: job listing, notification inbox, engagement and conversation lists, growth recommendations, repost automation settings, account feature reads, voice profiles (including the read-only effective-profile resolver), and writing prompts. Each remains workspace-scoped and read-only at the handler layer; mutations stay excluded.
- Hardened the notification inbox for workspace-bound credentials: account-wide rows (for example invitations from other workspaces) are now excluded when the calling token is bound to a workspace. Browser sessions and unscoped credentials keep the existing combined inbox.
- Timeline clip corners no longer steal trim and move grabs for fades. Fade handles are smaller, sit inside the clip edge when no fade exists, use a distinct pointer cursor, and ignore presses that never travel.
- Timeline snapping stays bounded when zoomed out, so clips no longer magnetize from seconds away.
- Wait at least one second between X video and GIF STATUS polls when the provider omits `check_after_secs` or sends 0, so uploads do not busy-loop the media endpoint and fail as rate-limited.

### Changed

- Releases no longer need a changelog preparation commit. Tag CI builds the draft notes from `CHANGELOG.md` plus `changes/` fragments, and a post-publish bot commit records the shipped section and consumes exactly the tagged fragments.

## [6.1.3] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Cloud Video Editor media can be deleted from the project media pool after its timeline references are removed.
- Video Editor exports retry WebCodecs source decoding with software acceleration when a browser decoder reports a decoding error. This recovers affected high-frame-rate VP9 recordings without changing the selected export format or codec.

## [6.1.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Publish the TypeScript SDK feature set as `@getopenpost/sdk` `0.3.0` instead of reusing the existing `0.2.0` package version.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Webhook intake results expose `body_authenticated`, reporting whether verification covered the raw request body. Header-only shared secrets report false; the flag describes the current request only.
- `openpost doctor` checks local CLI configuration without contacting any instance: version, platform, profile, instance, token presence and source, workspace, and config paths. Token material never prints. It exits non-zero with guidance when the instance or token is missing.
- TypeScript SDK: structured retry dispositions on every error (`never`, `after-delay`, `after-reconnect`, `reconcile-first`), JSON serialization, and a new `ambiguous` code for requests that may have executed. Drive retry buttons and automation from `disposition`, not the boolean alone.
- TypeScript SDK: per-rendition outcome helpers. `describeRendition` requires the provider native id before reporting `published` and maps unprovable rows to `unknown`; `summarizePublication` reports `pending`, `complete`, or `partial`.
- TypeScript SDK: a deterministic `@getopenpost/sdk/testing` mock with scenario-driven publish behavior (`immediate-success`, `processing-then-success`, `mixed-success-failure`, `rate-limited`, `reconnect-required`, `ambiguous-accept`), an `advance()` latch, operation history, and reset. The subpath is separate from the root import so production bundles never carry it.
- TypeScript SDK: a bounded `iterateOffsetPages` helper for offset-paged lists with `maxPages` and `maxItems` guards.

### Fixed

- Controlled sliders no longer turn internal step normalization into edits, so Image Editor export previews no longer restart repeatedly because of a small quality rounding difference.
- Old self-hosting guide links now open the corresponding documentation pages.
- Media uploads with an empty filename or a malformed MIME declaration now fail before any byte is stored, at session reserve and every validation entry point.
- Uploads whose bytes sniff as a specific contradicting type (for example declared images containing HTML, or declared video containing JPEG bytes) are rejected instead of silently adopted. Generic fallbacks stay allowed for device captures.
- Saving an Image Editor design with a group layer no longer fails with a server error.
- Keep automatically recovered marketing JavaScript import failures out of error tracking. Report failures that cannot reload and still need the visitor to retry.
- Stop periodic Video Editor autosave when its local project file has disappeared. Keep the unsaved edit and the existing save error visible so the user can restore the workspace file and retry without repeated background failures.
- Local Video Editor project creation now falls back to a direct file write when a browser rejects an atomic move from a stale handle.
- YouTube uploads reject titles containing `<>` and descriptions over 5000 bytes before a resumable session is created.
- LinkedIn rejects malformed post ids in publish responses instead of storing ids that can never be reconciled; a missing id stays accepted for reconciliation.
- TikTok media URLs must parse as HTTPS with a host, no credentials, and no fragment. Custom ports stay allowed for self-hosted instances.
- X posts containing characters the X API never accepts (U+FFFE, U+FEFF, U+FFFF) now fail validation before any upload or post is dispatched.
- Bluesky posts trim trailing punctuation from link facets, drop overlapping facets instead of sending provider-rejected records, skip mentions with malformed DIDs, and enforce the 300-character and 3000-byte limits before the record is built.
- A provider acceptance without a native post id or a reference to reconcile with no longer reports published. It stays pending with reconcile-only safety so it reconciles instead of retrying. Acceptances carrying a reconciliation reference (for example Instagram container flows) are unchanged.

## [6.0.4] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Capability checks no longer report a stale native URL setting after a post changes away from a link-share format.

## [6.0.3] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Removing a URL from a post also removes its hidden link settings from destination checks, so Threads does not keep reporting a link that is no longer in the post. Old validation responses no longer restore warnings after an edit.

## [6.0.2] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- Show saved OpenPost and local projects together in Image Editor, Video Editor, and Quick Cut, with compact storage and sync status. The storage choice now controls where new projects are saved.
- Give Quick Cut a shared editor start page, clear guidance after marking a selection, and compact kept-part rows with optional settings behind a disclosure.
- Start background removal as soon as an image is chosen or pasted, download pasted images automatically, and add an accessible draggable before-and-after preview.

### Fixed

- Newly connected instance-based social accounts now resolve their provider adapters immediately across composer options, capability checks, publication validation, comments, and MCP instead of waiting for a server restart. This covers Lemmy, PeerTube, PieFed, Bluesky PDS, Mastodon, and Pixelfed accounts.
- Instagram connection failures now explain when Meta returns no Business or Creator account linked to a Facebook Page the connecting person can manage.
- Treat an Instagram professional account's own comments as ours when collecting engagement, so they are not stored as incoming inbox items.
- Keep Quick Cut timeline scrubbing responsive by coalescing decoder seeks while moving the playhead immediately.
- Preserve local Quick Cut project links across reloads and keep valid projects visible when another local project is unreadable.
- Keep cloud image designs accessible when the local library cannot load.
- Allow n8n package releases and recovery through the trusted publishing workflow without rebuilding or redeploying the app.
- Video Editor browser checks now follow the explicit Quick Cut or full editor choice, so the new start flow can pass release validation.

### Removed

- Analytics and the engagement inbox only cover content published through OpenPost. Native provider history reads, the account-content discovery sweep, external analytics sources, and the analytics source filter are gone, along with their coverage warnings and provider read usage.

## [6.0.1] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Keep Image Editor workspace storage and device media import verification aligned with the current editor flow.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- Moved the public documentation to `openpo.st/docs` and kept old documentation links working through direct redirects.
- Replace the marketing Free tools card's decorative icons with direct links to the image editor, video editor, thread splitter, and character counter.
- The free-tools directory now has search and categories for images, video, converters, and writing and planning.
- Background removal preserves original image dimensions by applying the estimated mask to the original pixels. Device memory limits still apply.
- Aligned the Image Editor, Video Editor, and Quick Cut headers, save status, history controls, and Export placement.
- Made Quick Cut projects reload from their project URL and moved its editing and timeline controls into a compact toolbar.
- Numeric multi-layer transforms preserve the arrangement of the selection instead of assigning identical coordinates to each layer.
- Keep only the newest pending thumbnail render for each preview, without interrupting running work or mixing different preview instances.
- Refine Image Editor pixel selections by growing, shrinking, or inverting them, load a layer's visible alpha as a binary selection, and draw precise click-by-click polygonal selections.
- Put alignment controls in Transform and basic color adjustments before advanced controls, with selected images as the initial Color target.
- Add page naming and named exports, clear eyedropper scope, brush-opacity reset, direct media sources, and Added/Done feedback.
- Separate searchable workspace templates from starters and return cloud designs to the project browser.
- Preserve proportions when resizing with Fit or Fill, with Keep size and explicit Stretch options.
- The logo maker offers the full installed Lucide collection, loaded in batches as you scroll. Search matches Lucide names, aliases, tags, categories, and minor spelling mistakes.
- Logo colors include opacity controls for outlines, fills, solid backgrounds, and gradient stops. PNG and SVG exports preserve transparency.

### Added

- Publish native `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` container images under one multi-architecture OpenPost tag.
- Free browser tools for background removal, image colors and palettes, clipboard-image downloads, icon-based logos, and PNG/JPEG/WebP conversion. Image processing stays on the device, with no account or watermark. Supported conversion pairs have their own searchable pages and format guidance.
- Quick Cut has its own free-tool page, separate from the full Video Editor.
- Rasterize a layer or group, merge adjacent layers, or flatten a page into an image with one undo step. These commands bake the pixels inside the page and keep source media unchanged.
- Prevent merges that would change backdrop-dependent blending, and reject completed renders when the design has changed.
- Preview the encoded PNG, JPEG, or WebP output and exact byte count before exporting an Image Editor design.

### Fixed

- Prevented frontend CI health reports from fetching the repository's historical blobs.
- Prevent duplicate Markdown response headers when serving documentation alongside the public website.
- Keep dialog close buttons in their intended position when using the Dither theme, and fit the free-tools heading on narrow phones.
- Link directly to canonical documentation Markdown files from the public agent guide.
- Use the same ordered dither gradients across marketing, application controls, and documentation. Button hover and keyboard focus now lift pixel density, and chart fills keep square pixels at every height without changing values or series colors.
- Saved URL imports, stock media, stickers, Lottie animations, captured frames, freeze frames, generated audio, and processed video to Cloud Video Projects without asking for a local workspace folder.
- Kept preview menus usable in fullscreen, placed backgrounds below visual overlays, and exposed keyframe and Pen controls in compact workspaces.
- Distinguished real shortcut conflicts from intentional per-surface bindings and showed every active Split shortcut consistently.
- Waited for Kokoro pronunciation data before loading the speech model so its English voices initialize reliably.
- Keep Export as the rightmost Video Editor header action, after the export queue, with a matching accessible label.
- Fixed Video Editor render queue submissions from live projects and kept the Export dialog open with a recovery step when a render cannot be queued.
- Keep the Video Editor timeline, preview, and selection synchronized when switching sequences or opening compounds.
- Preserve Stock search state and in-progress Create audio work when moving between editor tools.
- Collect nested Facebook Page comment replies into the engagement inbox, threaded under the comment they answer.
- Explain when Facebook returns no manageable Pages instead of showing a generic provider setup error.
- Reuse the previewed bytes for downloads, Media, and composer attachments, and stop full-resolution exports when source media is missing or unreadable.
- Keep multi-layer alignment previews, crop rotation, curved text, lines, and centered page gradients in sync with saved Image Editor designs.
- Render Diamond page backgrounds as diamond gradients in the canvas and exported images.
- Image Editor layer outlines now follow text glyphs instead of the text box, update while typing, and disappear at zero width. Alpha-based outlines keep layer opacity separate from edge coverage.
- Make Image Editor trackpad pinch zoom 2.5 times more responsive.
- Keep imported Image Editor projects isolated from the previously open design, update the browser title after renaming, and open workspace templates without reloading.
- Isolate guide keyboard actions from selected layers, open the background image picker directly, and keep unsaved-work warnings visible when cloud and local recovery fail.
- Use readable background-removal progress and correct image-upload wording.
- Collect Instagram comment replies into the engagement inbox, threaded under the comment they answer.
- Collect nested LinkedIn comment replies into the engagement inbox, threaded under the comment they answer.
- Reject release container artifacts with invalid digests or mismatched version and revision labels on either supported architecture.
- Collect every YouTube comment-thread reply into the engagement inbox, not only the subset returned on commentThreads.list.

## [5.1.2] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- Server-only releases no longer wait for an Android package that their candidate CI intentionally skips.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Quick Cut now has a large preview, waveform timeline, focused editing panels, markers, and undo/redo. Choose Quick Cut or Video Editor when starting a video from the composer.
- Edit Quick Cut videos by selecting transcript words to remove. Transcripts and markers save with the project without adding subtitles.
- Both video editors can detect speech locally with Silero or find silence from audio levels without an AI model. Review suggested cuts and adjust pause length and padding before applying them.

### Fixed

- Videos sent from the composer now import into the selected editor. Silence analysis retains audible stereo channels and all selected Quick Cut audio tracks.
- Exact merged exports trim encoded audio padding at each cut, preventing overlapping timestamps from stopping the export.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-09-19

### Improved

- Video Color now focuses on one grading palette at a time, keeps the viewer usable on laptops, and lets you toggle scopes.
- Video and Motion inspectors put selected content first and disclose advanced settings. Text styles can apply to existing text from the browser.
- Image Editor tool variants are easier to find, expanded pages use the thumbnail strip, and tool options stay in one compact row instead of wrapping over the artwork. More actions keeps desktop commands available on narrow screens.

### Fixed

- Color edits respect locked tracks and keep their original targets when selection changes during a drag.
- Hidden Color scopes stop sampling frames, while Auto Balance and color picking remain available.
- Sequence grading opens its controls in an empty timeline and preserves the separate clip selection.
- Image Editor tool families use one aligned button with an attached variant menu. Text controls appear before layer metadata, and phone Color controls keep the live canvas visible.
- Image Editor header actions have clearer spacing around save status and Export.
- Editor scope icons are centered, scope labels render once, and curve handles retain their shape as panels resize. Video Color palettes name the tool they add, and compact Video and Motion layouts preserve preview space, clip navigation, and transport actions.
- Text, audio generation, export, and settings controls fit their panels without clipped labels or unreadably small editable values.
- Documentation code samples keep complete syntax highlighting when builds run under load.

### Changed

- Reorganized the public docs into Guides, Self-hosting, AI assistants, Automate, Video Editor, Image Editor, and a separate generated API reference, with focused SDK, HTTP API, CLI, MCP, skills, and n8n guides.

## [4.36.3] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- Prepared Android 0.2.37 for the current OpenPost API contract.

## [4.36.2] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- Prepared Android 0.2.36 for the current OpenPost API contract.

## [4.36.1] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- Fixed release validation for the new Meta analytics and TikTok reconciliation paths.

## [4.36.0] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- Updated the archive reader used by local AI models to remove a decompression denial-of-service vulnerability.
- Lemmy, PieFed, and PeerTube accounts with more than 250 posts or videos in the last 90 days finish their initial content discovery. The last page before the 250-item limit was rejected as oversized, so discovery failed on the same page every hour and never reached routine cycles.
- New comments on busy Facebook posts reach the engagement inbox. Comments were read oldest first from a single page, so once a post had more comments than fit on one page, every later comment was left out.
- Fixed Facebook and Instagram connect failing with `Invalid Scopes: pages_read_user_content`. Facebook and Instagram OAuth now request Meta's dependency permissions `pages_read_user_content` and `pages_manage_metadata` alongside comment and messaging scopes, and the Meta app setup guides list them.
- PeerTube accounts with more than 15 channels can connect and publish to every channel; the channel list now reads every page instead of stopping at PeerTube's default page of 15.
- PeerTube videos with more than 100 comment threads bring every thread into the inbox; older threads, and new replies on them, are no longer dropped after the first page.
- PeerTube account content discovery finishes its cycle and picks up new videos again. It used to get stuck repeating the same page once a channel had a video older than the discovery window, spending the daily read budget on that page and never finding newer uploads.
- Fixed Facebook video Stories and Reels failing when Meta had not finished fetching the video. OpenPost now uses Meta's hosted-file upload session, validates the credential-bearing upload host, keeps polling the accepted upload through temporary failures, and finishes only after the upload completes.
- Fixed provider network errors retaining credential-bearing request URLs in stored or logged error text.
- Fixed Threads posts with accents, curly punctuation, or emoji passing OpenPost's character check and then exceeding Meta's UTF-8 byte limit.
- Fixed Facebook analytics using feed-post fields for Stories, Reels, and video posts. OpenPost now requests the metric family supported by each Graph object type.
- Replies to replies on Threads posts reach the engagement inbox, threaded under the reply they answer. Only top-level replies were collected before, so a follower answering the account's own reply never showed up.
- Reconcile public TikTok videos when publishing completes without a public post ID, while keeping ambiguous matches pending instead of republishing or saving a broken link.

### Changed

- Photo and video editors use compact workstation-density controls: smaller inspector rows, icon-first toolbars with tooltips, tighter browsers, pickers, dialogs, and canvas handles. Theme colors and behavior are unchanged.
- Video inspector sections collapse with value summaries; the audio mixer no longer duplicates the clip EQ panel.
- Transition and effect catalogs open as picker popovers instead of inline scrolling grids.
- Image editor canvas bars collapse into one tool-options strip with a zoom and position status readout.
- Timeline scrolling skips recompute and subscription churn when scroll geometry is unchanged.
- Slider rows land the thumb where clicked with anchor-pixel scrub math behind one commit model.
- Transcript cue list collapses into a value-reporting disclosure with a selected-cue editor.
- Asset panel and page strip gain overlay and status modes for follow-up shell wiring.
- MCP lists every operation as its own tool by default; set `OPENPOST_MCP_MODE=search` to keep the previous search-first flow (`both` combines them, search tool names unchanged).

### Added

- The image and video editor guides are now illustrated with captured product screenshots that refresh automatically when the UI drifts.
- Added a full default MCP endpoint, a compact code-mode endpoint, secure local-file uploads, and RFC 9207 OAuth issuer metadata.
- Track whether each Publication was created through the web app, API, TypeScript SDK, MCP, CLI, or an automatic posting flow.

## [4.35.3] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Made release promotion tolerant of the parallel Android job uploading the APK early: the core asset check now only rejects files outside the full expected set.

## [4.35.2] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Pinned `devalue` to 5.9.2 to clear the Security audit advisory and aligned Expo mobile packages with the installed SDK, fixing the Android candidate check.
- Pointed the npm CLI wrapper at the current release tag so first-time installs download checksum-verified binaries.

## [4.35.1] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Added the official TypeScript SDK (`@getopenpost/sdk`): token-auth publications with per-account renditions, media session uploads, accounts and Social Sets reads, and job plus publication waiters with typed errors.
- Added the npm CLI wrapper (`@getopenpost/cli`): the `openpost` and `openpost-mcp` commands install verified prebuilt binaries from the GitHub release with SHA-256 checksum enforcement.
- Release binaries for the CLI and MCP proxy now ship detached `.sha256` checksums alongside every platform asset.

### Fixed

- The PeerTube category and licence pickers in the composer list the instance's catalogs again instead of coming back empty.
- PieFed replies now show whether the connected account already liked them, so the inbox offers Unlike instead of Like on replies the account upvoted.

## [4.35.0] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- The instance Discord bot now rotates its presence through all four activities every few seconds instead of sitting on one for half an hour.
- Searching for a PieFed community when choosing a post destination now returns communities that match the search, instead of the same list of active communities whatever was typed.
- Analytics for PieFed posts no longer fails when reading a post's votes and comment count: the post is now requested by the `id` parameter PieFed expects.
- The inbox now collects replies to comments on PieFed posts, not only the comments made directly on the post.
- Replies that a moderator removed from a PieFed post no longer show up in the inbox as blank comments or trigger new-engagement notifications.
- Deleting your own reply to a PieFed post no longer fails: the request now tells PieFed to delete the reply, which it requires.

### Added

- Connect Telegram channels and groups through an instance-owned bot: post a one-time command inside the chat, then schedule text and media messages from OpenPost.
- Drag video-editor sidebar content straight onto the timeline: backgrounds, stickers, stock assets, and Lottie animations now land on the hovered track at the drop frame with a live placement preview, and saved AI voice and music previews drag out as audio clips.

## [4.34.2] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Release announcements now fire on publication itself, so a skipped or retried pipeline step can no longer drop the Discord announcement.
- Server-only releases publish without waiting on the skipped Android packaging job.

## [4.34.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- Show the live OpenPost GitHub star count beside the wordmark on the public landing navigation.

### Fixed

- Analytics for Lemmy and PieFed accounts now lists only posts the connected account wrote, instead of other people's posts from the instance feed.
- Lemmy and PieFed image posts no longer fail at the image upload step: Lemmy uploads go to the instance's image endpoint, and PieFed uploads send the image under the field name PieFed expects.
- Discover only the connected account's own Lemmy and PieFed posts, and upload their images where each server accepts them.
- Accept maximum-lifetime API tokens within five minutes of client clock skew instead of rejecting them at creation.
- Coalesce editor ResizeObserver callbacks into one frame and skip unchanged sizes to stop layout loops.
- Treat blocked OPFS storage as unavailable before the video editor loads, with actionable export errors.
- Recover video-editor handle-database reads from stale IndexedDB transactions instead of filing errors.
- Drop benign ResizeObserver and contentless script-error noise from telemetry while preserving console output.
- Keep the GitHub star link out of the authenticated application sidebar and allow the hosted marketing site to read the cached public count.
- Release candidates now prove the full core product on their own tag instead of inheriting proof from a path-filtered main run.
- Server-only releases keep the released Android identity and publish without waiting for Android packaging; mobile releases still require a monotonic identity advance.
- Release preparation validates changelog and contract inputs before touching files, stages only the changelog and its fragments, and no longer captures screenshots, runs broad browser suites, or waits for main CI.
- A broken production no longer blocks shipping its fix; readiness gates deployment health instead.
- Generated-contract checks restore the working tree before reporting, and provider-claim derivation survives import and variable renames.

## [4.34.0] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- API token copying now falls back when browser clipboard permission is denied and leaves a selectable token with clear recovery instructions.
- Workspace image settings now open device upload first, confirm a completed upload, and keep the final workspace save explicit.
- Prevent the video editor from opening in browsers that lack its required filesystem, storage, or media APIs, and explain how to recover from blocked Brave filesystem access.
- Keep project creation working when a browser exposes Web Crypto without `crypto.randomUUID`.
- Keep the composer publishing warning hidden while pasted media is uploading, and align a lone required destination selector with its label.
- Keep URLs in post text when publishing media to X, Threads, Mastodon, and LinkedIn.
- Remove stale native link settings from existing media publications during readiness checks and publishing.
- Verify that ordinary URLs in body text remain supported alongside media, using the provider's text-plus-media APIs for [X](https://docs.x.com/x-api/posts/create-post), [Threads](https://www.postman.com/meta/threads/documentation/dht3nzz/threads-api), [Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/statuses/), and [LinkedIn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management/shares/multiimage-post-api?view=li-lms-2026-08). Native link cards and articles remain format-specific.
- Keep the MCP authorization action locked until its callback redirect starts, so repeated clicks cannot consume a second one-time authorization code or show a failure after the connection already succeeded.

### Added

- Keep configured Discord bot accounts connected and online through the worker Gateway.
- Rotate a truthful bot presence, with optional Twitch or YouTube streaming mode.
- Add the live OpenPost GitHub star count beside the authenticated app logo, linking to the repository.

### Changed

- Move Publications and Media into the sidebar's More menu, keeping the primary navigation focused on Inbox and Analytics.

## [4.33.0] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- Lemmy replies keep their posted and edited times and show whether the connected account already liked them, and Lemmy account content discovery no longer drops every post.
- Lemmy community search now lists communities, and published Lemmy posts keep the community's host in their destination reference.
- PeerTube engagement now collects each comment's text, author, and replies instead of storing empty comments.

### Added

- Send Paddle customer, subscription, trial, cancellation, payment, and payment-failure events to a configured Discord webhook as embeds with user identity, email, plan, status, amount, and profile avatar when available.

## [4.32.1] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- MCP OAuth responses preserve both `mcp:read` and `mcp:full` when a client requests both, while the issued token keeps full-access enforcement.
- Discord bot analytics no longer inherits the publishing certification gate, so configured bot accounts can reach normal analytics readiness.
- Mobile browser pairing now continues into the app after approval instead of starting a replacement pairing code when the authenticated session refreshes the navigation tree.
- Video Editor preview frames no longer dispose a media input while an asynchronous decoder read is still using it.
- Discord bot readiness follows the configured account and evidence policy instead of adding a production-only certification blocker.
- A single required destination field sits in the right column on wide composer layouts, while mobile keeps the field full width.
- The changed-file commit and push gate now runs on macOS's system Bash as well as newer Bash releases.

## [4.32.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Connect Pixelfed instances over per-instance OAuth and publish photo posts and albums with captions, per-image alt text, content warnings, and visibility controls.
- Connect PeerTube accounts with instance credentials, pick a channel, and publish videos with titles, descriptions, privacy, captions, and thumbnails. Uploads resume after interruptions and delivery waits for transcoding.
- Connect Lemmy accounts with instance credentials and post discussions, links, and images to communities, each with its own title, body, validation, and reply inbox.
- Connect PieFed accounts with instance credentials and publish to communities through its native API, sharing the Lemmy authoring experience.
- Connected Fediverse accounts now name their detected server software (Pixelfed, PeerTube, Lemmy, PieFed, GoToSocial, Akkoma, Pleroma, or Friendica) instead of showing a generic provider name.
- New `/platforms` guides for Pixelfed, PeerTube, Lemmy, and PieFed, plus self-hosting integration guides for each.
- Maintainer diagnostic reports are on by default for self-hosted instances. Upgrading activates an external reporting channel where previous versions sent nothing: instances send privacy-limited failure reports (normalized error codes, build, sanitized stack frames, occurrence counts) to the official OpenPost receiver through a bounded queue that never blocks application work and never touches the application database. Set `OPENPOST_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false` to opt out; the environment disable always wins and clears pending reports. Browser reports additionally stop on Do Not Track or Global Privacy Control.
- The official receiver (`POST /api/v1/diagnostics/ingest`, enabled with `OPENPOST_DIAGNOSTICS_INGEST_ENABLED` plus the server-only `OPENPOST_DIAGNOSTICS_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`) validates, quota-limits, and forwards accepted cross-instance reports to the maintainer Discord channel.
- Uncaught browser exceptions and unhandled promise rejections now report through the viewer's own instance as normalized codes with app-relative locations, never message text. Chunk-load deployment skew stays excluded.
- Send feedback is now one click away in the app sidebar, the mobile More menu, and the Video and Image Editor headers, and onboarding invites new workspaces to report anything missing or broken.

### Fixed

- Background edits update the existing Image Editor canvas without rebuilding its layers. Selection outlines use bounded temporary buffers, and failed export setup releases its renderer.
- Maintainer diagnostics now accept reports from every supported provider, preserve build and storage context through the official receiver, and keep the installation identity stable across release-container recreation.
- Scene Browser caches analysis and thumbnails in browser storage, so Cloud projects no longer require a picked local folder.
- Reversed, processed, and nested-sequence audio previews handle unsupported media without an uncaught decode failure and clears the previous source's audio while a new source loads.
- Local file-handle storage reopens closed IndexedDB connections before starting a transaction.
- A Facebook post's first comment, which the Page publishes itself, no longer shows up in the engagement inbox as a new comment or sends an "engagement received" notification.
- LinkedIn "root plus comments" publications with more than one comment no longer fail at the second comment; later comments are now published as replies under the previous comment.
- Fixed marketing navigation losing clicks before the page was ready, decorative channel icons exposed as unnamed images, and long changelog entries overflowing phone screens.
- MCP connections now accept requests for both `mcp:read` and `mcp:full`, including repeated scopes. Read-only requests retain read-only access, and unsupported or unregistered scopes remain rejected.
- Removed excess space from the right side of README action buttons.
- Adding new changelog sections during release preparation no longer splits existing release-note bullets.
- Restored distinct social preview images for every marketing and documentation page.
- Prevent SQLite account registration from failing when another connection writes while the first-user and identity checks are running.
- Follow-up posts in a published Threads thread no longer show up in the engagement inbox as new replies or send an "engagement received" notification.
- YouTube videos with comments turned off, or collection runs that hit the daily YouTube API quota, no longer tell you to reconnect the account in the engagement inbox.
- The feedback dialog category options (Bug, Idea, Question) are truly centered: the radio input no longer occupies flex layout.
- The dialog overlay no longer applies a full-screen backdrop blur, removing a suspected source of the intermittent horizontal white line and lowering compositing cost.

### Changed

- Image Editor color previews and ordinary document edits now preserve unchanged pages and layers, reducing work during sliders and transforms. Page-strip thumbnails render as queued images after color gestures finish.
- Console error reports preserve original exceptions and stack traces. Marketing telemetry includes the Cloudflare deployment revision.
- Publication Builder job reports retain safe failure categories, including invalid director, rendition, or reviewer output, without exposing private model text.
- Application, marketing, and documentation builds receive the server-only source-map upload credential through Turbo without putting it in frontend bundles or build hashes.

### Improved

- Made the landing page load faster with inline styles, responsive product screenshots, and lower-priority decorative images.
- Release preparation checks generated files, types, lint, tests, and browser flows before pushing. Local commits can be verified together and sent in one push.
- Frontend tests run alongside the canonical build in CI, the application browser suite is split across two required runners, and Android builds can reuse cached Gradle task outputs.

## [4.31.2] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- Bluesky comment collection no longer creates blank, author-less comments for replies that are blocked or deleted in the thread.
- Deleting or deselecting a text item while its on-canvas editor is focused no longer throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')`. The removal blur now ends the editing session without committing, since there is nothing to commit to.
- Listing, replying to, hiding, and deleting comments through the API and MCP tools now works for Mastodon accounts and Bluesky accounts on a self-hosted PDS, instead of failing with "comments are not supported".
- Scheduled account checks and account content discovery now use the account's own adapter for Bluesky accounts on a self-hosted PDS and for Discord bot connections, instead of the default Bluesky server or the Discord webhook adapter.
- Nested replies collected from Bluesky and Mastodon now appear under the comment they answer in the engagement inbox, instead of as separate top-level comments.
- Stale import recovery no longer reloads blindly. The app and marketing site share one bounded controller: one decision per failure, persisted per-asset and overall attempt budgets with no time-window reset, and automatic reloads only with evidence. URL-less import failures consult SvelteKit's own deployment check, reloading once per running build on a confirmed newer deployment.
- Editors never lose unsaved work to an automatic import reload. While the layout reports unsaved changes, chunk failures fall back to the error boundary's explicit retry action.
- Safari below 16.4 no longer hits an unclassified theme startup failure on `/video-editor`. The pinned `@asamuzakjp/css-color` no longer uses regex lookbehind in its calc/var/relative-color detectors, and unsupported-engine failures are reported under `theme_unsupported_browser` with the CSS fallback.
- Telemetry keeps deployment context across identity resets and attaches surface, environment, edition, version, and revision to every exception capture, including buffered ones. Import failures retain the first-party asset pathname.
- Console-logged failures now reach error tracking. `console.error` output is bridged into PostHog with a `console_error` boundary while preserving console output.
- Official production builds fail loudly when `POSTHOG_UI_HOST` is missing while source-map upload is enabled, instead of silently uploading symbols to the wrong region.
- The Video Editor animated-image subscription no longer feeds its own effect: cache callbacks run untracked so a warm-cache mount cannot invalidate the subscribing effect.

### Changed

- Documented the browser baseline (Safari 16.4 and equivalents) in `docs/development/frontend.md`.

### Added

- Self-hosting guides and deployment files for ZimaOS, CasaOS, Coolify, Dokploy, Portainer, Dockge, and NixOS.
- Binary, Docker run, and reverse-proxy installation guides.

## [4.31.1] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Keep saved Discord channels valid when reopening a draft, and show the same publishing readiness as the saved Publication.
- Keep inline error notices readable in dark Dither themes by using the shared destructive action foreground and surface roles.

## [4.31.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Social Sets can save per-account formats and reusable provider settings as defaults for new publications. Choose a format before setting presets; the available fields work across the media that format accepts. Drafts copy those defaults and keep any settings changed for that post. Settings tied to attached media stay on the post.

### Fixed

- Keep Settings navigation and its Refresh action usable when a panel download fails.
- Mobile navigation keeps the selected menu item focused when the menu finishes opening. Keyboard navigation and Back preserve that selection.
- Hide the previous Video Editor project while its pending save finishes, then open the next project. If the save fails, retry it without losing edits.
- Video Editor save errors use wording that applies to both local and Cloud Video Projects.
- Discord bots check Attach Files permission before sending media. If permission is missing, the error explains how to allow attachments or remove them from the post.
- Quick Cut can reopen legacy single-source projects and keep their cuts while it refreshes media details.
- Video Editor can reset all transition parameters to their defaults.
- Image Editor first-edit guidance selects the largest editable text layer by its font size.
- Theme revision requests include the selected organization, so revision details load under the correct library.
- Video Editor Composition Timeline zoom responds to the shared slider, and legacy keyframes remain draggable.
- Video Editor agent reports the requested tool name when a plan contains an unknown tool.
- Quick Cut re-encodes mid-stream cuts without keyframe metadata instead of labeling them lossless.
- Quick Cut rejects saved projects with unsupported media rotations.
- Billing recovery refreshes the correct organization's data after returning from the payment portal.
- Video Editor shows a label while local scene captions are being generated.
- Video Editor agent applies the transition style it reports when adding a transition.
- Publications shows the connected account avatar beside each destination when one is available.
- Video Editor selects the complete keyframe after pasting it into the value graph, so its controls can show the new value and easing.
- Quick Cut's preview can be focused and toggled with a button, while retaining its context menu.
- Image Editor color grading renders raw image data through the canvas fallback when GPU rendering is unavailable.
- Video Editor skips motion channels it cannot render when baking keyframes.
- Discord bot destinations require a channel before publishing or scheduling, even when account options cannot be refreshed. Incoming webhook connections keep their fixed destination.
- Discord settings show channel-dependent mention controls and clearer embed guidance.
- Telegram content compatibility no longer carries a permanent testing block. Account readiness remains responsible for publishing authorization.
- Destination settings keep required choices open for correction and show a top-right error when Done is pressed without them.
- Phone notifications fit within the screen and leave the dialog title and close button accessible.
- Discord embeds use named fields, and mentions can include more than one person or role.
- TikTok photo covers use attached-photo choices. Bluesky content labels use the allowed choices.
- Settings without provider choices explain why there is no usable control.
- Unsupported settings stay out of the main form unless they carry a saved value; their reasons remain available under Unavailable.
- Telegram chat choices come from the account's verified bot installation, with only that connected chat selectable.
- Telegram messages and attachments have a channel preview in the composer.
- Account-specific settings take precedence over general provider options, including webhook accounts with no editable destination settings.
- The API reference documents session-cookie auth for provider-readiness admin evidence; API tokens remain rejected.
- Dither shows readable publishing errors in dark mode and visible hover feedback in the sidebar. Destructive buttons retain readable text in every state.
- The profile menu now labels app preferences as Settings.
- Marketing pages recover automatically when a page-module download fails during initial load, instead of remaining on an error page.
- The landing page meme screenshot no longer shows blurred strips beside the editor.

### Documentation

- Added separate illustrated self-hosting guides for all 12 social networks, with provider-specific setup, callback URLs, permissions, connection checks, and troubleshooting.
- Rewrote customer, self-hosting, and AI assistant guides; reorganized navigation and added distinct page icons. Screenshots can be enlarged, and OpenPost connection screenshots follow the reader's light or dark theme.
- Corrected LinkedIn first-connection permissions, Telegram self-hosting instructions, Pinterest approval requirements, Calendar views, and AI client setup. Older integration URLs redirect to the new guides.

## [4.30.3] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Accept Bluesky MP4 videos up to 300,000,000 bytes and 10 minutes. Apply the same limits to thread authoring and provider validation, and continue rejecting MOV files.
- Retain safe provider error codes, subcodes, trace IDs, and HTTP status in terminal background-job reports. Intermediate retries remain unreported, and provider-returned prose is excluded from logs.
- Accept TikTok WebM videos consistently during authoring and publishing.
- Reject mixed video attachments and multiple videos within an X or Bluesky thread segment before scheduling.
- Ask again for declined Facebook and Instagram permissions when connecting or reconnecting an account.
- Keep the remote post link when a later thread reply or YouTube thumbnail step fails. Retrying resumes from the saved provider result without publishing the completed prefix again.
- Preserve Mastodon's returned post URL through the API and background publishing worker.
- Preserve public JavaScript asset paths in browser error reports so PostHog can resolve source maps. Private URLs and query parameters remain redacted.

### Changed

- Use the landing page's transparent logo in the desktop and mobile documentation headers, with matching light and dark variants.

### Added

- Add a generated media-limits guide with exact catalogue limits, provider references, and account-specific exceptions.

## [4.30.2] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Public feature icons now use larger, simpler shapes without the surrounding logo tiles. Small transparent pixel cuts add dithering, with green, orange, yellow, and blue colors drawn from the README badges.

### Fixed

- Updated the mobile app's Expo SDK 57 packages and native plugins together to keep Android release builds compatible.
- Video Editor background and effect galleries use still previews while browsing and animate the active preview on hover or keyboard focus. This avoids compiling the shader catalog when a panel opens or scrolls.
- Video Editor clips can move between visual tracks. New projects label these tracks Visual 1 and Visual 2; existing project names remain intact. Track moves support undo, cancellation, linked audio, and saved projects, and reject locked or occupied destinations.
- When `post create --schedule` creates a draft but scheduling fails, the CLI reports the publication ID and a command to retry scheduling without creating another draft. Add `post schedule <id> --at <time>` as an alias for `publication schedule`.
- If scheduling succeeds but the status lookup fails, the CLI reports that scheduling was accepted and provides a command to check the existing publication.
- Public logos and the README wordmark use burnt orange on light backgrounds and peach on dark backgrounds. The landing page logo follows the visitor's theme switch.
- Sign-in pages no longer download the authenticated workspace navigation and dialogs. The workspace shell loads once after sign-in and remains mounted during navigation.

## [4.30.1] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Use the Dither palette's accent for focus rings and editor selections, removing the unexpected purple highlights from the orange and green themes.
- Load pinned translation plugins from installed dependencies so builds continue when the plugin CDN is unavailable.

### Changed

- Preserve the exact outlined wordmark and Converge geometry in the README lockups. The bottom-left orange module dissolves outward and down-left through sparse square transparent gaps, while the other three modules remain solid.
- Recolor standalone transparent orange marks to the exact peach-orange `#FD975D`; reversed and background-backed artwork keeps its existing treatment.
- Keep the authenticated app logo on the active theme's focal action color instead of forcing the public peach mark.

## [4.30.0] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Document the saved Publications status tab in the browser-storage privacy inventory.
- Read historical release manifests reliably when the local runtime drops captured Git output.
- Keep Video Editor property, playback, audio, and effect panels neutral while preserving the active theme on controls.
- Restore the original landing layout, typography, colors, and buttons while retaining sparse Dither effects. Refresh product screenshots across the app, marketing, and documentation assets.

### Added

- Give the README download, release, build, and star badges readable Dither textures in light and dark. GitHub Actions refreshes their actual values after CI and releases, every six hours, or on demand.

### Changed

- Give the README star-history chart a transparent background, crisp line, and Dither area fill. Scheduled updates preserve the same style in light and dark.
- Keep the plot focused on the data by removing its repeated title, logo, and repository legend.

## [4.29.0] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Preserve contextual alt text, roles, and thumbnail timestamps when publication media is created or replaced through MCP or the API.
- Reject Bluesky images larger than 2,000,000 bytes during validation, scheduling, and immediate publishing.
- Restore the viewer's workspace theme when opening a public profile directly, and use Dither for anonymous visitors.
- Render multiple delivery targets for the same account without breaking the publication list.
- Apply the selected theme’s tab shape and active indicator consistently.
- Align the New post button with its adjacent menu button.
- Keep the calendar's date range visible and preserve its scroll area beneath the shared page header.

### Changed

- Use restrained orange-brown Dither colors by default across the app and mobile theme catalog. Saved theme choices still take precedence. The landing page adds orange action accents and Dither textures while keeping its green, blue, and lilac palette.
- Use compact, consistent app headings and theme icons. Keep feature artwork in public materials.
- Rebuild Publications around searchable rows, account summaries, and expandable delivery details. Keep shared List and Calendar actions visible while content loads, and remember the selected status tab when switching views.

### Added

- Show audience composition by account in Analytics, using stored follower counts and a separate total for smaller accounts.
- Animate Dither button textures on hover, focus, and press, respecting reduced motion.

## [4.28.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Video Editor includes all 30 Paper shader families: 20 backgrounds, seven image filters, and three logo animations. Search Backgrounds or Effects, then adjust colors, patterns, motion, and placement. Logo animations can follow transparency, dark areas, or light areas of a clip. Existing presets retain their appearance, and authored shader settings persist through saves, undo, and export.
- Dither pixel-wave artwork in empty states, textured loading placeholders, and matching progress bars. Texture is decorative and disappears in forced-colors mode. The app's loading preview uses the same shared controls.
- Dither button gradient transitions for hover, keyboard focus, and press, with reduced-motion support.
- Coordinated Dither accent hue controls for light and dark appearance, individual theme color pickers, and directional two-color dither gradients.
- Chart inspection emphasis with fading tooltips that stay within the visible chart area.
- Dither and Dither Moss themes, each with light and dark schemes, in Settings → Organization → Appearance.
- Reusable dithered button, card, and chart treatments, plus a decorative gradient component adapted from Dither Kit. Custom themes can select the new recipes. Chart values, keyboard inspection, and solid value outlines remain available.

### Changed

- Simplified the Analytics feature mark and added distinct marks for Media, Inbox, Accounts, Recorder, Ideas, Automation, Grow, Repost, Workspaces, and Meme Maker. The family now appears in application page headings, the README, the landing tour, and customer guides.
- Kept Recorder save controls visible on narrow phone screens.
- Organizations with no saved appearance now start with Dither in both light and dark. Saved organization themes and Workspace overrides keep their current choice. Workshop remains available and handles theme recovery.

### Fixed

- Theme preview scene, color scheme, and viewport selectors now switch and close correctly.
- Custom Dither drafts can be saved and published through the API.
- Theme selectors keep one selected value and close after selection.
- Chart inspection preserves keyboard focus when the pointer leaves and dismisses with Escape.
- Theme color pickers preserve transparency, and Quick Cut's start controls fit narrow phone screens.
- Recorder preview text stays readable in light appearance.
- Quick Cut distinguishes an empty catalog from a failed load; Editors gives search and folder setup more room on phones.
- Theme previews show normal control styles while keeping sample controls noninteractive.

## [4.27.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Simplified workspace navigation, grouped Calendar and List under Publications, and remembered the last view.
- Moved connected accounts and workspace settings into the workspace menu. Grouped personal appearance, language, sounds, and usage data choices in Preferences.
- Added image and video creation choices under New and kept secondary tools in More.

### Fixed

- Keep Video Editor layout changes from stealing focus after another control is selected.
- Preserve keyboard focus when moving between sections of the mobile menu.
- Fixed version history failing to load on PostgreSQL for publications with publishing authorization events.
- Replaced the composer's unexplained red validation icon with a labeled issue count beside the publishing controls. The issue list still explains each blocker and opens the affected field.

## [4.26.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- A delayed, theme-aware navigation progress bar with reduced-motion support.
- MP4 recording fallback for browsers that cannot record WebM, with matching MP4, M4A, and Ogg download filenames.

### Fixed

- Keep Settings section navigation visible while panels download or load data. Show placeholders only for the selected panel.
- Keep Publications tabs, Inbox navigation and filters, Grow account selection, Media filters, and page actions available while content loads. Calendar date controls stay visible while loading another range.
- Screen, camera, and microphone recordings import together without treating microphone WebM files as video. Downloaded audio recordings use their actual tracks when imported again. Failed imports retain downloadable captures and show the error beside recovery controls.
- Video Editor sidebar column controls now extend each panel beside the timeline independently, matching FreeCut. Collapsing and reopening panels preserves their width and docking, asset tabs reopen their panel, and the preview remains visible while changing columns.

## [4.25.1] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Show one language control on the Image Editor start page when signed in.

## [4.25.0] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Point the Features navigation to the landing-page feature section and tighten footer link spacing.
- Rewrote the public channel, tool, FAQ, About, Contact, and Security pages around creating content and running a business. Free tools now open directly into a compact workspace, with practical guides below.
- Added a five-second screenshot tour with seven views, pause controls, and reduced-motion support. Refreshed the footer with a paper-plane illustration and an interactive character wordmark.
- Moved Features links to the landing page and consolidated developer and self-hosting information into the help centre, with redirects for the removed marketing pages.

### Fixed

- Size Pinterest and Telegram marks consistently with other provider icons.
- Match landing-page product screenshots to the selected light or dark appearance.
- Cloud video project lists now show saved names after renaming, restoring a revision, or resolving a conflict.
- Apply saved or system appearance before the app downloads, preventing a white flash when entering or refreshing in dark mode.
- Keep timeline hover timecodes inside the editing area and hide the native scrollbar when the custom timeline navigator is visible.
- Restore rate stretching for imported clips. Dragging a clip edge no longer fails before changing its playback speed.

### Improved

- Image and Video Editor start pages now share a compact layout with direct new-project actions, visible format choices, and recent work below. Custom settings remain available. Local video projects ask for folder access when needed.
- Load analytics only when enabled and permitted by the user's privacy choice, reducing startup downloads.
- Load workspace theme support after sign-in and keep the full theme catalog out of the app shell.
- Download Settings panels when opened, retain loaded panels during navigation, and offer refresh recovery if a panel download fails.

### Added

- Grade image layers or the full page with the same color wheels, RGB curves, histogram, waveform, parade, and vectorscope used by the Video Editor. Save grades with the design and preserve them in previews and exports.

## [4.24.3] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Accept bot certification evidence with no OAuth scopes, and apply the same production requirements when recording and checking it. Certification now covers every authoring format in an output profile, while changes to any format invalidate the old evidence.

## [4.24.2] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Allow verified Telegram bot installations to publish without an OAuth grant. Readiness still requires an active account and a verified installation for the same workspace and chat.

## [4.24.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Thread drafts now save after inserting, removing, reordering, or replacing entries without segment-position conflicts. Existing entries retain their destination overrides.
- Fixed account content discovery jobs failing before provider requests on PostgreSQL installations.
- Request Discord bot permissions for attachments, embeds, and message lookup during installation, alongside viewing channels and sending messages. Existing installations can reconnect to grant the required permissions.

### Security

- Update Sharp to 0.35.4 and js-yaml to 4.3.2 to fix reported image-decoding and YAML parser vulnerabilities.
- Update Vitest to 4.1.11 and fast-uri to 3.1.6 to fix newly reported development-tool advisories.

### Changed

- Bring pricing choices higher on the page, show the selected monthly or yearly price once, and remove repeated billing copy.

## [4.24.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Hosted pricing now has three plans: Solo at $29/month, Team at $59/month, and Agency at $99/month. Annual billing costs ten monthly payments. Every plan includes the full product, with 1, 3, or 10 workspaces and 1, 5, or 10 people per workspace.
- Every workspace includes 10 social accounts, 500 scheduled publications per calendar month, 10 GB of media storage, and 10 GB of monthly uploads. No seat add-ons, AI credit packs, or automatic overage charges.
- Pricing uses a full feature comparison table with audience labels, monthly and annual totals, and a plan selector on phones. Billing settings use the same catalog as signup and checkout.
- The Hosted HTML fallback also lists the three current plans and monthly prices.
- Cover scheduling, queues, AI writing and Ideate, memes, reposts, inbox messages, analytics, media organization, audience discovery, developer tools, and security on the landing page and in the README.
- Stack README content for phones, show editor screenshots inline, and include surrounding app context in partial product screenshots. Give the crops more room inside their colored containers.
- Refresh product screenshots from the app and include the meme creator in the existing capture process.
- Rebuilt documentation with Fumadocs, focused publishing guides, a compact self-hosting section, searchable API operations generated from OpenAPI, and a custom responsive light and dark design. Old documentation links redirect to their replacements; engineering references now live in the repository.

### Operators

- Replace the configured Paddle prices with the new amounts before deploying this catalog. Solo retains the internal `founder` ID. Starter and Pro price settings have been removed. Previous signed purchase choices must be renewed; subscriptions are not migrated automatically. See the billing and usage development guide for rollout and rollback requirements.

### Added

- Connect Telegram channels and groups from account settings using a chat-bound, expiring command. The dialog explains where to find the chat ID and how to grant the bot publishing access.

### Fixed

- Show Telegram connection availability from the configured bot and provider readiness checks instead of always marking it as planned. Provider approval remains required.
- Load the instance API reference and schema examples from the versioned API path so administrators can use the documented operations.
- Align Image and Video Editor header colors, project names, workspace controls, and export actions. The Image Editor icon saves and returns to the project gallery, while drafts opened from the composer return to their post.
- Let Escape dismiss editor menus while a project name has focus. Keep save feedback and touch controls visible on narrow screens.
- Fix the Android app crashing on startup after a server has been saved or the user has logged in.
- Hid the mobile documentation tab scrollbar so it no longer crowds the active underline. Tabs still scroll horizontally.
- Replaced the page-action text chevron with a matching interface icon.
- Added AI page actions, section filters in search, clearer setup and troubleshooting guides, and mobile navigation that keeps the active section in view.
- Add all 16 AI client setup guides, client logos, and a visual MCP client picker.
- Keep the shared-text notice and customization button below the post text so they do not overlap the last lines in destination tabs.

## [4.23.0] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Fixed Video Editor cloud saves failing on reactive project state, screen recordings rejected for missing WebM duration metadata, and anonymous camera or microphone choices crashing the recorder.
- Browser Stop sharing now imports the finished recording. Failed imports remain recoverable, and a late upload cannot insert clips into a different project.
- Kept canvas text entry local until commit, preserved spaces while typing, corrected zoom and volume icons, and made project metadata and recording setup fit narrow screens.
- Kept cloud exports and render queues in browser storage, separate from local workspace folders. Cloud save status now names OpenPost.
- Preserved public Svelte error codes in telemetry while continuing to redact URL parameters.
- Rejected malformed saved speech-cleanup timings while preserving valid settings.
- Theme creation opens the new draft in the editor. Unpublished drafts remain available to edit, and failed creation keeps the entered name for retry.
- Publishing again and restoring revisions use the current server revision. Consecutive organization default and lock changes preserve the saved choice.
- Applying a theme finishes when the server saves it. Background refreshes no longer disable Appearance controls, and failed reads offer a retry.
- Kept failed page imports as failures during stale-file recovery, preventing a secondary `universal` crash on the public site and app.
- Restored the anchored horizontal slide from Ideate to Build with AI while keeping async feedback steady.
- Allow signed-in users to create Image Editor designs when built-in templates have no workspace, while keeping private templates scoped to their workspace.
- Check star history every six hours and skip chart generation and commits unless the star count exceeds the last chart update. The first successful chart update records the baseline.
- Video Editor: applying a saved color grade now replaces the grade portion of the clip's effect stack FreeCut-style (non-grade effects preserved, applied entries always enabled), and curve click-to-add matches FreeCut point density.

### Changed

- Simplified Appearance with shorter copy, one creation entry, and organization defaults and locking in an expandable section. The large preview appears only while testing a theme.

### Improved

- Analytics totals animate when measurements change. Refresh, copy, and save labels morph without moving their controls or changing screen reader announcements.
- Added a hand-drawn accent to the landing headline and keyboard-accessible screenshot zoom, with reduced-motion support and direct image links when JavaScript is off.
- Added a selectable product preview with fresh 2x screenshots, layered editor and publishing details, and a tools-and-resources grid. Removed repeated full screenshots, embedded usage videos, and fictional workflows.
- Restored two linked community testimonials.
- Shortened the README and added editor feature sections, screenshots, and matching feature icons. Image and video editor headers now use those same icons.
- Product images now refresh automatically during release preparation. Documentation uses neutral colors with blue links.
- Scope capture now uses FreeCut's cadence: 256x144 samples at ~15fps while playing, 384x216 samples every 220ms while paused.
- Scope dock renders CPU scopes at most every 220ms (scrub storms coalesce to the latest sample) and falls back to CPU scopes if WebGPU setup wedges past one second instead of leaving the dock blank.
- CPU scope path documents the full/legal range contract (`normalizeScopeValue`, default full-range BT.709 matching FreeCut); the IRE 0-100 grid was already at parity.
- User effect presets and grade presets stay browser-wide in localStorage (shared across every project/workspace on the device). This is documented as intentional in both preset modules rather than migrating to FreeCut's workspace-file pattern.
- Vector auto-key now checks the sibling axis: enabling auto-key on `y` and editing `x` starts the coupled position lane, matching FreeCut.
- Value-graph drags show a time/value axis-lock indicator while Shift is held, and the mouse wheel no longer fights an in-flight drag. Plain-wheel value panning now follows FreeCut's scroll direction.
- Motion thumbnails carry loop metadata, and box-scale gating helpers exist for presets and modulators (breath-pulse stays available on text: it drives transform scale, which cannot reflow type).
- The expression dock now offers FreeCut's per-property preset catalog (~50 Adjust/Motion/Timing presets) with a full syntax guide, inserted at the cursor into the expression draft.
- `prop()` and direct links accept shape stroke props (trim start/end/offset, taper widths/lengths) with the same render defaults as the shape pipeline; results apply to the item fields, not the transform.
- Spring easing preview timing is ported from FreeCut's settling math (mass 0.3 / friction 18 → ~153ms) with the mirror ping-pong return leg for future timed previews; the graph preview itself stays duration-independent.
- Mask shapes now open a dedicated Mask canvas tool: Pen/Draw-new mode switch, direction-preserving smooth conversion, corner conversion, and point deletion, all with atomic undo and topology/keyframe guards.
- Power window has a bespoke pane (shape, window, matte, correction groups) with a UV-space gizmo preview; center/size drags preview live and commit atomically.
- Paused transition hold: while paused inside a transition window, participant lanes keep their transition-relative decoded frame (0.001s settle epsilon, ramp-owned dataset flags) instead of cold-seeking on every scrub tick, matching FreeCut's paused-lane prearm behavior.
- Fast reverse (>1x) uses FreeCut's 20-sample decode-window plan (stride = rate*fps/60, 60% refill rule): the clock skips intermediate authored frames and the lane holds its last decode, with skips counted in diagnostics.
- Diagnostics gain render-source, transition session (count on rising edge), and reverse-skip counters in the panel, the copyable report, and a new Alt+Shift+P performance-overlay toggle.
- Scrub seeks share one deduped filmstrip decode per media + timestamp (generation counter + inflight map), prewarm filmstrips when a seek fallback starts, and drop superseded clones instead of flashing stale frames, matching FreeCut's schedule/warm/dispose behavior.
- New text-only scrub overlay: while paused with a preview frame, visible text/subtitle items paint through the shared canvas raster (one paint per animation frame, pointer-events-none) instead of forcing full media seeks.
- Save-frame now resolves its source frame with FreeCut's ±2-frame rule: paused scrub captures use the preview frame instead of the committed playhead.
- Rate-stretch edge drag with snap and duration caps, canvas-pixel nudge (Shift+Arrow 1 px, Command/Control 10 px), mid-drag Alt/Shift trim morph, slip/slide guards, transition-midpoint snap targets.
- Alt+move stays slip by design (simpler UX); FreeCut-style Alt duplicate-drag intentionally not ported.

### Added

- Video Editor export dialog: one-click presets (Master / Archive, Web 1080p, Social, Draft preview) that set container, codec, quality, and resolution atomically; manual dropdowns remain as overrides.
- Video Editor export preflight now announces slow render paths before export: main-thread fallback when background rendering is unavailable, animated-image fallback, and audio-mix fallback, plus a warning when the codec was auto-switched.
- Video Editor storage settings now show the live session proxy-cache size next to the proxy controls.

## [4.22.0] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- Rebuilt the landing page around a launch workflow with interactive destination examples, real editor previews, and mint, lilac, and blue accents. Motion respects reduced-motion preferences.
- Removed orange hero glows from marketing pages and the orange gradient and button glow from documentation.

### Fixed

- Removed repeated primary links from the mobile marketing navigation.
- Made animated pricing amounts readable to screen readers in monthly and yearly billing.
- Keep thread text clear of the remove button at narrow widths and expose the button on keyboard focus.

### Improved

- Keep AI, save, scheduling, and copy feedback in place with short state transitions. Copy failures offer a retry and ignore results from an old workspace.
- Navigate image layers without changing selection, with animated group expansion and predictable keyboard focus.
- Preview page and thread moves with the keyboard, cancel with Escape, and undo an accepted reorder. Thread dragging also works with touch and scrolls at the edge.
- Add and remove tags with short transitions, composition-safe entry, and a second Backspace before deletion.
- Show upload and AI phases with measured progress when available and motion for unknown progress.
- Keep password and scheduling errors next to their fields, with keyboard focus on the first invalid password field.

## [4.21.0] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- Production dead-code analysis now includes application sources. Removed unused components, helpers, dependencies, and testimonial assets.
- Public-page tests check rendered content without maintaining a second copy of the prose.
- GitHub releases contain binaries and the signed Android APK. Scan reports stay in Actions; redundant release and Android manifests are removed.
- Workflow checks use actionlint.
- Brighten Workshop chart colors in light and dark mode, with matching web and mobile theme tokens.
- Compact Analytics source filters and row actions, keeping post details accessible without clipped buttons.
- Group applications under `apps/`, browser tests under `tests/`, deployment files under `deploy/`, and repository manifests under `config/`. Existing root task scopes and public Go module names remain unchanged.
- Remove the marketing claims ledger and its checks, stale skills locks, obsolete Codex hook, and local Impeccable state. Keep maintained design sources under `assets/design/`.

### Fixed

- Fixed Android startup failing with “undefined is not a function.” Startup, sign-in, and shared queries now support React Native's cancellation APIs, including runtimes without `AbortSignal.throwIfAborted` or `DOMException`.
- Documentation edit links point to the current source directory, and the default theme initializes once.
- Release builds now place server, CLI, and MCP binaries where the upload step expects them.
- Bluesky mentions now resolve complete multi-segment handles instead of a single captured domain segment.
- Bluesky accounts hosted on a self-hosted or third-party PDS can now be connected and used: OpenPost resolves the PDS from the handle's DID document at sign-in and talks to that server for the account. Sign in with the handle, not an email. Accounts on bsky.social are unchanged. Video uploads still go through Bluesky's video service and are not covered for accounts on other PDSes. When the PDS cannot be resolved, sign-in now fails instead of falling back to bsky.social.
- Composer destination tabs now show only "All" or the connected account name.
- LinkedIn profile refresh now saves the profile photo on OpenPost storage so browser privacy controls and expiring provider URLs cannot hide it.
- Preserve each repost stage and completed removal across worker restarts, enforce evaluation deadlines, and use each provider's correct native unrepost identifier.
- Production pages now link the PWA manifest and register the service worker from nested editor routes. Install icons include PNG and maskable variants.
- Service-worker updates wait for open windows to close. Public app caches exclude API responses, authorization URLs, query-bearing navigations, and original media. Updates remove the previous unrestricted page cache after activation.
- Cached local image designs can reopen and export offline without fetching server configuration. Uncached app pages show a translated offline page. Editor code and image models cache when used, without bulk downloads at installation.
- Use the active theme's chevron for the Developer shortcut disclosure.
- Applying an updated built-in theme now saves its actual revision instead of failing with a generic workspace-theme error.

### Added

- Let trusted self-hosting proxies sign users into OpenPost and provision their first workspace without a second onboarding flow.
- Schedule several native repost stages from one workspace rule or publication override, with an option to remove the preceding repost before the next stage.
- Desktop users can install OpenPost from the profile menu. Supported browsers offer a dismissible, one-time installation invitation; other desktop browsers show manual installation instructions.

### Improved

- Redesigned all 15 Image Editor starter templates with distinct palettes, stronger typography, and editable layouts for announcements, quotes, carousels, and thumbnails.
- Fixed cropped template previews on phones and kept template names readable without truncation.

## [4.20.0] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Images inserted from Android keyboards now attach in native idea capture and publication composers, preserving the written text and existing attachment validation, preview, and upload flow.
- Fixed cached navigation leaving Plan & usage, Accounts, Audit, and Ownership settings hidden behind loading placeholders.
- Kept billing and account settings subscribed to query updates and reconnect refreshes.
- Kept Grow polling until queued work completes, even when successive responses are unchanged.
- Preserved draft and broad publication invalidations while avoiding unrelated refreshes for draft-only saves.
- Showed background refresh failures in Activity without hiding cached content.
- Removed duplicate theme catalog requests and refreshed affected workspace theme caches after organization changes.
- Refreshed media search results after a rename changes which files match.
- Kept saved theme draft revisions current when publishing fails, so retries use the latest draft.
- Testing a theme now previews it across the app without changing saved appearance preferences. Stop testing or leave Appearance to restore the saved theme.
- Image and Video Editors now share their core chrome, font catalog, and versioned color processing path. Image preview and full-resolution export preserve layer and page grades, while Video grading keeps animated and multi-clip edits intact, applies sequence grades after compositing, bounds imported LUTs, and offers a simultaneous four-scope view.
- Connected account profile photos now render after a provider profile refresh, including LinkedIn photos served from signed media URLs.
- Selected account features now fill their card without mismatched side strips.
- The agent workflow check now validates repository-owned files without requiring machine-managed skills or GitHub access. Use `bun scripts/agent-doctor.mjs --live-labels` for the optional live GitHub label check.
- Retry media uploads after temporary provider failures instead of asking you to replace valid media.

### Added

- Cloud Video Projects now keep portable authored state, Project Assets, versioned autosaves, named checkpoints, Trash, and explicit conflict branches inside the owning Workspace.
- The native mobile app can safely capture or import footage offline, then upload it with a non-destructive preparation recipe for completion in the web Video Editor.
- Quick Cut source projects and standalone or in-editor recordings now use the same Cloud Video Project and Project Asset contract, while keeping an explicit Local-only path.
- Five sourced buying guides answer questions about founder social tools, product updates, multi-platform scheduling, self-hosting, and automation. Find them under Resources → Buying guides, with current Hosted readiness limits and links to supporting documentation.
- Added optional per-Workspace email reminders when the publishing queue has fewer scheduled days left or its final queued Publication finishes.

### Changed

- Project Asset uploads use workspace storage limits and checksum reuse without appearing in the normal Media Library. Sync state reports pending work, active upload, saved state, or a storage problem instead of claiming success early.
- Cloud Video Project lists, history, conflicts, assets, and mobile captures now share cache-safe reads and refresh affected data after each change.
- Group repository community policies, launch templates, social artwork, and browser configuration with their owners. Remove the outdated roadmap and stop tracking local design review reports. Run browser suites through `bun run test -- e2e` or `bun run test -- e2e-app`.

## [4.19.1] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Made the mobile navigation shorter, icon-only, and easier to scan.
- Simplified mobile composer destination tabs to show the account identity without repeated provider and format labels.
- Gave analytics platforms stable, distinct theme colors so charts no longer appear mostly gray.

### Fixed

- Kept language and other nested menus inside the phone viewport.
- Showed YouTube destination settings before a compatible video is attached.

## [4.19.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Add a vendor-neutral external application platform with operator-managed public and confidential OAuth clients, S256 PKCE, granular REST scopes, one-hour access tokens, rotating refresh tokens, replay-family revocation, RFC 7009 revocation, and optional policy-controlled dynamic client registration.
- Let workspace administrators approve one, several, or all eligible current workspaces and choose the current social accounts each application can use. Future workspaces and accounts require explicit approval.
- Add durable signed webhooks for publication lifecycle events, bounded retries, delivery inspection, and one-time signing secrets.
- Add consent, connected-application, and instance application-registry screens, plus generated API contracts and operator documentation.
- Restore missing video project media in one batch by scanning a chosen folder and its subfolders, reviewing exact matches and conflicts, then confirming the safe relinks.

### Changed

- Put Test and Apply actions on every theme card, and switch appearance mode when a tested theme only supports light or dark.
- Add dark variants for Studio, Playroom, and Cloud Garden across web and native theme manifests.
- Give every built-in theme five distinct analytics colors and show the full palette while previewing a theme.
- Keep routine app page spacing compact even when a theme uses spacious presentation layouts.
- Show only the plus icon for the central mobile create action while preserving its accessible name.
- Apply every organization theme to the Video Editor and Image Editor chrome while keeping preview, timeline, canvas, guide, handle, scope, and meter geometry on stable editor colors.
- Make dense video inspector, effects, Color, Motion, asset, audio, and workspace controls readable in both light and dark themes.
- Let Image Editor canvas controls, transparency grids, selection handles, and previews use the protected canvas palette instead of organization page colors.
- Use one brand-aware color picker across the app, Image Editor, and Video Editor instead of browser color inputs.
- Export Main, any top-level sequence, or a reusable motion composition without leaving the active editor timeline. The export dialog shows and uses the selected timeline's own resolution, frame rate, duration, range, and mix.
- Browse shortcuts on an interactive keyboard and edit primary and alternate bindings together.
- Review every shortcut preset change and conflict before applying it, then undo the import if needed.

### Fixed

- Keep mobile appearance choices inside the More menu instead of opening them beyond the screen edge.
- Make menus opaque so page content cannot bleed through and reduce text contrast while scrolling.
- Prevent light themes from leaving dark preview surrounds, transport bars, timeline docks, track canvases, Color timelines, or Motion empty states inside either editor.
- Restore the anonymous Image Editor create, reload, and export flow after undefined icon bindings broke the public route and tool rails.
- Prevent the Image Editor custom-size and gradient color controls from overflowing narrow screens.
- Translate the remaining visible Video Editor color, assistant, and local-processing labels.
- Theme the Video Editor timeline navigator and protected scrollbars instead of leaving a dark strip in light themes.
- Load AI meme previews in order so every suggestion appears without a manual retry.
- Stop obsolete token-refresh jobs for disconnected or revoked accounts from retrying and raising terminal background-job alerts.
- Record a safe error message when a real token refresh fails.

## [4.18.0] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Keep page and mobile data available while OpenPost refreshes it in the background, with fewer repeated loading states when moving through the app.
- Load the app shell with one startup request instead of a settings chain, and keep workspace data isolated per workspace and per signed-in actor.
- Apply one organization theme across authenticated product chrome while preserving provider marks, status meaning, workspace identity, and specialized editor visuals.
- Page theme revision history and uploaded assets with stable cursors instead of loading an Organization's full history at once.
- Record the editors hub as the one multi-section loading exception in the server-state query migration spec. Each image and video section keeps its own delayed boundary while the shared header and search stay mounted.
- CI now runs the full release-candidate matrix for release tags instead of every push to `main`. Main pushes plan from the pushed diff, so untouched surfaces (for example the Android candidate) skip their jobs, and the release workflow waits for the tag's own CI run before promoting its artifacts.
- Backend tests run once with the race detector and coverage together instead of as two separate suites.
- Keep the active video project's resolution, frame rate, duration, timeline item count, media count, and recovery issue count visible in the desktop editor bar.
- Add an immediate retry action when a local video project save fails.
- Bring the video project library and audio-effects rack onto the organization theme and type scale, including the shared keyboard and touch-friendly slider for audio panning.

### Fixed

- Published Facebook Page image Stories through Meta's required unpublished-photo flow and report generic Meta rejections without suggesting the Story may already be live.
- Keep published organization themes visible after the full built-in catalog, show mobile navigation inside phone previews, preserve valid color randomization, and render pill actions for theme families that specify them.
- Paginate the Publications Activity, failed-jobs, and publication-history lists with cached infinite queries. Loaded pages stay in the Query cache under the workspace and bucket key, so revisits and tab switches reuse them instead of refetching page one.
- Invalidate exact activity buckets on publication moves. Reschedules, retries, dismissals, restores, publishes, draft deletes, and day-dialog deletes carry old and new buckets, so unrelated buckets and the failed-jobs list no longer refetch. Generic refreshes keep the previous whole-workspace behavior.
- Give the publication detail route a stable loading chrome. The cold detail load renders inside the shared page container instead of a bare loader.
- Add a lint boundary against effect-driven fetching. `scripts/check-query-effect-fetch.mjs` fails on transport or imperative Query reads inside render-path effects, with named exceptions; it runs in the Query migration policy stage next to the raw-GET gate.
- Let AI meme suggestions finish after five seconds while keeping meme and feedback request bodies size-limited.
- Increased the mobile bottom navigation labels from 10px to 12px with a 16px line height, keeping 56px touch targets on small screens.
- Prevent hidden project import controls from widening the video project library on phones.

### Added

- Give organizations a versioned theme library with built-in and custom themes, workspace assignments, safe scheme fallback, live previews, and web and mobile support.
- Add a guided theme editor for semantic color, type, spacing, shape, motion, icons, fonts, and decorative assets.
- Add an Appearance section in organization settings to browse the library, edit drafts, publish revisions, and assign workspace themes.
- Added an `openpost grant-admin --email <address>` maintenance command so self-host operators can promote an existing account to instance administrator when no account can reach instance settings, for example after restoring a database volume that predates the automatic first-admin bootstrap.

## [4.17.2] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Exposed the hosted product, pricing, trial terms, and policy links to website review crawlers that do not run JavaScript.

## [4.17.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Let automated reviewers crawl the signed-out Hosted landing page while keeping private app routes out of search results.

## [4.17.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Added consent-aware browser analytics choices with persistent first-party, limited cookieless, and fully off modes across the app, website, and documentation.
- Added a Refresh profile action to connected account details so current provider names and profile pictures can be fetched without reconnecting the account.
- Published verifiable OpenPost Agent Skills, current API and MCP discovery metadata, and a standard favicon for integration directories.

### Fixed

- Kept utility and authenticated app pages out of search indexes while preserving public profile discovery, and compressed app HTML for browsers that accept gzip or Brotli.
- Corrected app crawler rules, Content Signals, OAuth resource discovery, and public Link headers.
- Extended production proof across the new discovery endpoints, generated artifacts, crawler policies, Content Signal headers, and favicon.

### Changed

- Persistent browser analytics now preserve cross-subdomain acquisition, returning visits, sessions, country, bot filtering, and FCP while replay, broad autocapture, heatmaps, surveys, console capture, network payloads, and precise location stay disabled.

## [4.16.1] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Finished the hard cutover to `openpo.st`. Current application, media, telemetry, email, API, CLI, MCP, mobile, and public metadata now use the new domain. Former public hosts only redirect to their matching `openpo.st` address.

### Fixed

- Restored the public Hosted landing page at the app root so visitors and payment-provider reviewers can inspect current pricing and policies before signing in.

## [4.16.0] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Made X engagement reply collection incremental and bounded, with a durable per-account daily read budget, provider backoff, and slower age-based polling so scheduled and manual refreshes cannot repeat costly full conversation searches.
- Keep Video Editor source-monitor shortcuts available when browser-cached code loads without Svelte compiler helpers.
- Keep video timeline thumbnails visible when a decoded frame is released during rendering.
- Reload the current public or application page when a deployment leaves the browser with an outdated JavaScript module.
- Fixed Instagram account discovery failing when Meta rejects an unsupported IG User field.
- Discover every connectable Facebook Page and linked Instagram professional account across paginated results and Business Portfolios.
- Classify Meta token, permission, rate-limit, and transient publishing failures correctly, and retry only the known transient Threads container propagation response.
- Resume interrupted Instagram container publishing without creating a duplicate post.
- Normalize uploaded media filenames to valid UTF-8 before storing them.
- Align Analytics result columns and identify social accounts with their platform throughout account-sensitive actions and messages.
- Fixed Android release checks so normal builds can reuse the current identity and release preparation automatically advances the app version and version code.

### Changed

- Synchronized whole-account Analytics and Repurpose contracts, privacy disclosures, provider readiness claims, operator guidance, and generated web/mobile API consumers.
- Advanced the Hosted Privacy Policy to 2026-09-01 to disclose bounded eligible external-content text while preserving the raw-payload, credential, remote-media, and telemetry exclusions.
- Analytics measurements now preserve provider source, integer unit, aggregation meaning, reporting period, and optional display scale while keeping legacy analytics history readable.
- Polished Analytics into one accessible managed-and-external content scan with truthful account-history coverage, server evidence details, and phone-safe Repurpose actions.
- Require current Pinterest Standard access and matching live certification before production connection or publishing is advertised.
- Keep Pinterest production delivery gated on current Standard access and live certification, and stop rather than replay a Pin create whose outcome may be ambiguous.
- Move OpenPost's canonical website, documentation, Hosted service, public media, telemetry proxy, and support address to the `openpo.st` domain while keeping the recorded old-domain compatibility paths available.
- Keep the Hosted sign-in page reviewable without creating a second marketing homepage, with direct pricing and policy links plus a no-JavaScript fallback.
- Re-register a dynamic Mastodon application when its configured callback changes, so a new connection returns to the current Hosted domain while existing grants stay intact.
- Replace the custom billing form with Paddle's managed checkout overlay and support Paddle transaction links without requiring an OpenPost sign-in.
- Redesign marketing and documentation social preview images with clearer type and restrained OpenPost branding.

### Added

- Resume Pinterest video Pin registration, upload, processing checks, creation, and read-only reconciliation from durable checkpoints.
- Validate the MP4 video and public JPEG or PNG cover before Pinterest receives publishing work.
- Discover bounded, read-only Pinterest Pins and exact-link managed Pin IDs without creating Publications.
- Persist explicit-window Pinterest account and Pin impressions, engagements, saves, Pin clicks, outbound clicks, supported video views, and weighted click rate while preserving missing metrics.
- Keep Pinterest discovery, analytics, and publishing behind independent current Standard-access and certification evidence.
- Added workspace-bound 15-minute Telegram connection commands with authenticated one-time webhook consumption, verified channel/group permissions, and explicit since-installation coverage.
- Added certification-gated Telegram bot publishing for text, photos, videos, PDF documents, and compatible media groups, with permission rechecks, ordered caption-overflow messages, and durable receipts. The bot path remains unavailable until its exact deployment and operations have current approval and certification evidence.
- Added authenticated Telegram channel observation from bot installation onward, including external channel posts, semantic reaction counts, account-only member counts, and independent observation and analytics readiness.
- Added Discord bot installation with guild selection and permitted text or announcement channel targets while keeping incoming-webhook connections available.
- Added certification-gated Discord bot delivery for typed embeds, direct attachments, and permission-approved member or role mentions with deny-all implicit mention defaults and durable reconciliation. Bot mode remains unavailable until certified; existing incoming-webhook connections remain supported and are not placed behind the bot certification gate.
- Added certification-gated, bounded Discord bot analytics for approximate guild membership plus reactions and thread replies on exact OpenPost-published message receipts. Bot analytics remain unavailable until certified, never read guild message history, and do not affect existing Discord webhook support or invent views, reach, or impressions.
- Added a bounded account-content inventory with immutable analytics snapshots, discovery checkpoints, normalized observations, and optional provider discovery and batch-measurement contracts.
- Added durable, rate-aware account content discovery with bounded initial history, daily eligibility, truthful provider outcomes, and crash-safe page continuation.
- Added bounded YouTube upload discovery with paginated channel history, lifetime video statistics, and exact matching to OpenPost-published Renditions.
- Added source-bound whole-account analytics reads with deduplicated OpenPost and external content, per-account discovery coverage, and provider metric semantics.
- Added stored, explainable analytics insights with compatible-period ranking, explicit insufficient-data states, source context, and unified OpenPost and external content results.
- Added an editor-authorized Repurpose action for managed and externally discovered analytics content that opens fresh local direction review without changing the source, creating a draft, contacting a provider, or starting an AI build.
- Added date-bounded YouTube Analytics report metrics while keeping Data API lifetime counters visibly separate.
- Added bounded account-content discovery for connected Instagram professional accounts, Threads profiles, and Facebook Pages, with approved-scope checks, safe links, truthful partial coverage, and exact matching to OpenPost-published Renditions.

- Added bounded public-post discovery for Mastodon and Bluesky with server-scoped identities, safe links, explicit partial coverage, pagination, and exact matching to OpenPost-published Renditions.
- Added bounded X and scope-gated LinkedIn Organization Page account-history discovery. X provider reads remain disabled until the operator grants a positive daily request budget, and LinkedIn member history remains unavailable.
- Added instance-owned Pinterest, Telegram bot, and Discord bot application contracts, typed destination settings, and provider-safe target identities while preserving Discord incoming webhooks as a separate connection mode.
- Added durable, single-use signed bot connection codes and safe idempotent webhook ingestion for upcoming bot providers.
- Connect Pinterest accounts in development or certification flows, page every board, and load sections only for the selected board.
- Recheck Pinterest board ownership, section relationship, and account access before publishing work begins.
- Publish certified single-image and multi-image organic Pinterest Pins to the exact selected board and section with ordered media, title, description, destination link, image alt text, and AI-generated disclosure.

- Prevented concurrent Threads account connections from mixing provider user IDs, and rejected token/profile identity mismatches.
- Kept an Image Editor design open when device storage rejects the final save.
- Marked the active Image Editor page for assistive technology and kept coarse-pointer color swatches inside the picker.
- Keep effect and transition previews smooth by rendering only visible cards through bounded, deduplicated preview queues.
- Apply effects to the current selection or a timed adjustment layer, and place transitions only on valid cuts without false errors when reapplying the current choice.

### Changed

- Rebuilt the Video Editor Color workspace around dedicated grading controls, graded filmstrips, scopes, curves, and full keyframe editing.
- Matched FreeCut's grading readouts and section workflow with labeled scope guides, parade and vectorscope targets, visible grade actions and preset gallery, adjustment-layer creation, and per-section reset, bypass, and remove controls.
- Matched FreeCut's effect-stack workflow with one-click effect insertion, compact stack controls, collapsible panels, selection-wide bypass, and Color-aware effect filtering.
- Isolated Motion into its own composition preview and timeline, with blank composition creation, canvas controls, last-composition restore, and exact Edit return navigation.

- Matched FreeCut's source-pixel crop workflow with multi-clip scrubbing, reset and auto-key controls, signed edge softness, and the same fixed-source crop geometry in preview and export.
- Rebuilt playback controls around FreeCut's live speed and fade workflow, including mixed multi-clip values, linked A/V rate stretching, reset actions, reverse status, and one undo entry per gesture.
- Matched FreeCut's multi-clip audio core with linked-audio selection, live dB gain and fade controls, throttled pitch editing, gain auto-keying, mixed values, and atomic resets while retaining OpenPost's advanced EQ and cleanup tools.

- Migrated legacy ratio crop keyframes to source pixels so the keyframe graph, canvas handles, inspector, preview, and export use one unit contract.
- Matched meme caption sizing and line spacing to the pinned memegen renderer, retried transient previews, and made meme and discovery JSON generation use strict schemas with bounded recovery.
- Kept rejected AI builds on direction selection, aligned generated directions with create limits, and made ideation start from one optional brief and an explicit choice.
- Kept CLI media usage output aligned with the Publication API contract.
- Updated MCP prompts and the scheduler widget to use canonical Publication operations and results.
- Corrected API migration, settings navigation, and provider-readiness wording in the public documentation.
- Restored iOS builds on Xcode 26.2 while the pinned Expo packages await upstream Swift compatibility releases.

### Added

- Added composer-native AI ideation, five-direction drafting, durable platform-specific Rendition generation, voice profiles, internal source checks, and opt-in meme recommendations.
- Analytics can now compare daily views, engagement, and follower changes by post, platform, or account. Summary stats and the publication table are easier to scan.

## [4.11.0] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Simplified the Video Editor workspace around the preview, contextual inspector, and resizable timeline while keeping advanced actions in focused menus.

### Fixed

- Made Space control playback even when a menu button has focus, with Backspace lift delete and Delete ripple delete preserved.
- AI generation now retries once when the provider SDK reaches its internal deadline before the feature request budget is exhausted.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Added right-click and Shift+F10 segment actions to Quick Cut, including preview, export, enable or disable, ordering, and removal.
- Added right-click and Shift+F10 actions for selecting, reconnecting, and removing Quick Cut sources.

### Fixed

- Let release planning retain the previous release owner for paths deleted since the last tag.

- Restored Quick Cut reconnect, success, and stream-selection reset messages in every supported locale.
- Made the translation gate reject static frontend message calls that are missing from the catalogs.
- Removed dependent segments, marks, saved handles, and stale preview URLs when a Quick Cut source is removed.
- Kept source removal atomic when workspace persistence fails and returned cleanly to the empty state after removing the final source.
- Kept multi-source controls compact by showing stream settings only for the active source.
- Kept notifications inside narrow mobile viewports instead of extending past the right edge.

## [4.9.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Add direct right-click actions for reordering, resetting, toggling, and removing Video Editor effects.
- Add transcript word context actions for copying, cutting, staging, restoring, and committing edits.
- Add right-click actions for opening, renaming, duplicating, reordering, and closing Video Editor sequence tabs.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Let production releases resume an already prepared candidate without trying to create an empty commit.
- Show Video Editor shortcut keys using the active keyboard layout when the browser provides it.
- Make Space control the active video monitor without clicking focused controls, with Backspace for lift delete and Delete for ripple delete.
- Saved keyboard bindings now control duplicate, select all, group, nudge, reorder, copy, paste, and delete actions in the 2D composition timeline without hijacking focused controls.
- Prevent touch-sized timeline resize controls from covering clips, transitions, and empty space in narrow windows used with a mouse or trackpad.
- AI post building and meme suggestions now retry transient managed-provider failures within their full content-generation budget instead of failing after five seconds.
- Keep video editor shortcuts active after selecting a timeline clip with the pointer.
- Create the SQLite database directory before opening it, so a fresh install with a volume mounted over the data path boots instead of failing with a misleading "unable to open database file" error.
- Duplicate migration version numbers no longer silently skip migrations. Versions 094 and 108 were each assigned to two files, so `108_idempotency_records.sql` never ran (requests carrying an `Idempotency-Key` failed with 503 "no such table: idempotency_records") and `094_workspace_invitation_delivery.sql` was skipped on upgraded databases. The skipped migrations are renumbered to 110 and 111 so existing installations heal on their next start, and the migration runner now refuses to start when two files share a version.
- Make track rename and reorder shortcuts editable, removable, and portable through Video Editor shortcut presets.
- Keep the Video Editor keyframe graph and dope sheet usable together at narrow widths.
- Keep compact calendar date ranges visible and align published-history checks with the visible calendar item.
- Keep the mobile Video Editor inspector actions clear of the timeline at short phone heights.
- Release commands now stay bound to the OpenPost repository when a checkout has extra review remotes.

- Analyze, refresh, or cancel one video or image Scene Browser index from its media-row overflow or right-click menu.
- Delete project media from its overflow or right-click menu with an exact timeline-impact warning, shared-file protection, and durable failure recovery.
- Use target-aware timeline right-click menus for transitions and applicable clip actions such as join, freeze frame, layout, captions, and keyframe cleanup.
- Open reverse, scene splitting, captions, speech cleanup, text-to-speech, and compound clip tools directly from timeline clip context menus.
- Copy and paste color grades across selected clips from the timeline context menu.
- Join a split clip directly with its previous or next continuous neighbor from the timeline context menu.
- Choose a fast scan or frame-accurate local AI verification when splitting clips at scene changes.
- Generate, refresh, extract, and consolidate clip captions from one target-aware timeline menu.
- Generate, cancel, and remove preview proxies from each video source menu.
- Rename reusable video sequences from their media-library menus.
- Generate and reuse source transcripts from each audio or video media menu.
- Relink missing or changed video editor media directly from its media-row menus.
- Select media with Command/Ctrl-click or Shift-click, then generate missing proxies or delete the batch from one compact toolbar. Right-click preserves a selected group and reports partial deletion failures without hiding affected sources.
- Select reusable sequences with Command/Ctrl-click or Shift-click, combine them with media sources, and delete the full asset selection from one confirmed, durable operation.
- Let self-hosted operators collect account and content analytics through per-platform HTTP sources when provider analytics API access is unavailable.
- Drag across project media and reusable sequences to select them together, then use focused Delete, Escape, or Command/Ctrl+A shortcuts without stealing timeline or text-editing keys.
- Browse project media and reusable sequences in a responsive grid or compact list, with five persistent card-size choices.
- Edit shape and mask points from a focused right-click menu without losing a multi-point selection.
- Choose the default style for new transcript and AI captions without overwriting later caption edits.
- Toggle canvas-object snapping independently from timeline snapping with `Shift+S`, the canvas magnet, or editor settings.
- Switch timeline edit tools with `V`, `Y`, or `U`, and seek visible edit points with Up or Down.
- Nudge selected visual items by 1 or 10 canvas pixels with remappable keyboard shortcuts.
- Open Scene Browser and focus its search with a remappable Command/Ctrl+Shift+F shortcut.
- Switch between Graph, Dope Sheet, and Split keyframe views and use remappable, scoped keyframe editing commands in Edit and Motion.
- Edit graph and dope-sheet keyframes from target-aware right-click menus with keyboard access and saved shortcut labels.
- Close one timeline gap from empty space or every gap on a track from its right-click menu, with sync-lock, linked-media, lock, and one-step undo safety.
- Add video or audio tracks and remove every empty track from the track-header right-click menu, with safe handling for empty timelines and groups.
- Let instance administrators edit the base and platform-specific writing prompts used for AI social-post generation.

## [4.7.0] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Reject malformed changelog fragments before release preparation can omit and delete them, and keep generated release notes formatter-clean.
- Stop the Video Editor project catalog from migrating preserved schema backups and creating recursive backup copies before a project is opened.
- Enabled Pop, Zoom, Spin, Pulse, and Breath motion on text without changing its layout or line wrapping.
- Prevented unused or disconnected Quick Cut sources from blocking valid exports.
- Keep long timeline waveforms responsive by rendering only the visible window, with centered peaks and exact trim and reverse mapping.
- Merge Quick Cut sources with different selected audio-track counts without dropping tracks or failing during transcode.

### Added

- Preserve timestamp-derived frame-rate metrics for imported and relinked video so variable-rate and dropped-frame sources keep accurate trim and frame-selection behavior.

### Changed

- Batch consecutive color effects into one GPU pass so stacked grades preview and export with fewer full-frame draws while preserving the same ordered color output.

## [4.6.2] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Document the disk-backed Video Editor, Quick Cut, Recorder, local models, export queue, and explicit Media handoff without retired cloud-project or return-token claims.

### Fixed

- Keep transcript cuts from removing or retiming captions tied to clips on locked tracks.
- Keep corrected auto-caption lines, transcript search, karaoke, and edit-by-transcript words in sync while retaining usable word timing.
- Keep auto-caption word timing inside edited cue bounds and treat a cleared word as deletion instead of retaining a blank transcript token.
- Keep exact merged WebM Quick Cut exports in VP9 and Opus, show real export eligibility before rendering, and reject invalid ranges before they enter the project.
- Keep camera and microphone recording available when a previously selected input was unplugged by falling back to the browser default and clearing the stale choice.
- Preserve the originating draft when sending a Video Editor export to OpenPost and attach the uploaded video when the composer opens.
- Resume a previously running Video Editor render queue after reload while keeping interrupted renders safely paused.
- Refresh the open Saved exports list for every completed queue job, including jobs that finish within the same millisecond.
- List saved image-sequence folders beside rendered files and delete a sequence folder recursively after confirmation.

## [4.6.1] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Restore the saved Video Editor workspace before opening a project deep link or creating a project from another OpenPost surface.
- Keep selected-clip actions contained in a compact, touch-safe inspector toolbar.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-08-27

- The Video Editor inspector now shows only relevant Properties, Motion, Effects, or Transcript controls while keeping export actions fixed in place.
- FreeCut schema 15 projects now open as backed-up, writable OpenPost projects with their effects, audio levels, transitions, keyframes, captions, Lottie settings, and Motion compositions preserved.
- The writing canvas is open again, scheduling is shorter, and the desktop media picker shows every source.
- Interface sounds now start enabled for visitors who have not saved a preference.
- The landing page leads with the product, the navigation is shorter, and pricing is easier to scan.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Added Copy as draft for reusing a sent Publication without carrying over its delivery or schedule state.

### Fixed

- Kept connected accounts healthy when OAuth refresh fails because of a provider rate limit, server error, or timeout.
- Blocked X videos outside the provider's supported aspect-ratio range and stopped retrying media that X rejected during processing.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Video Editor audio ducking: per-clip sidechain settings (`duckOthersDb`, `attackSec`, `releaseSec`, `targetTrackIds`) lower other tracks while a clip plays. Inspector offers direct toggle, amount, attack/release, and scoped track selection with sensible copy. Preview and export share the same gain envelope, including attack/release ramps, deepest-duck overlap, muted/solo/visibility, speed and trim windows, nested sequences, and bus/master ordering. Changes are undoable.
- Quick Cut now has per-source audio and video track selection with durable export semantics. Probing enumerates every video and audio track and stores the selected track indices per source. Project parsing remains backward compatible and validates impossible selections. Preflight, stream copy, transcode, and merged export honor the selection and can produce audio-only or video-only output.
- Video Editor karaoke captions: per-word highlight mode for subtitle items using existing `SubtitleCue.words` timings with configurable active-word foreground and optional active-word background, exposed compactly in the subtitle properties panel.
- Shared deterministic karaoke word selection and cached subtitle layout so preview and export resolve the identical active word at exact frame boundaries, with untimed cues falling back to normal captions without flicker and with line wrapping preserved.
- PNG, JPEG, and WebP image-sequence export for full project, in/out range, and marker batches with exact frame counts, deterministic zero-padded names, and preserved FPS, dimensions, and effects.
- Alpha behavior: PNG and WebP preserve transparent backgrounds; JPEG flattens to the project background. WebP has explicit capability detection with honest fallback/error copy and no silent conversion.
- Bounded directory output via File System Access and ZIP fallback, with streaming/batched worker artifacts and accurate progress, cancellation, and cleanup.
- Worker and main-thread ownership with queue support for image sequences.
- Video Editor audio effect rack: compressor, stereo pan, reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, and distortion share a deep typed effect-chain abstraction and run identically in realtime preview and offline export. The rack is ordered, bypassable, resettable, bounded for safety, persisted/migrated, clone-safe, and undoable as one gesture. Compact accessible UI uses shared controls with good defaults.
- Video Editor beat detection: browser-local, cancellable analyzer for the selected audio or video clip that generates deterministic beat and downbeat markers at project frames with deduped labels and colors. Timeline insertion is atomic and undoable, the analyzer yields to the main thread on long clips, and the compact accessible panel uses shared controls and Paraglide copy.
- Local post-capture noise reduction for recorded mic/webcam/audio clips: per-clip persisted `audioNoiseReductionEnabled`/`audioNoiseReductionAmount` (0-100), compact accessible controls in clip properties, deterministic spectral gate that runs entirely on-device with identical preview and export output, bounded CPU/memory and abort/cleanup, no cloud upload, and correct ordering with EQ, pitch/speed, ducking and mixer.
- Video Editor recording now detects browser capabilities, exposes an explicit cursor mode where supported, and preserves honest system/tab audio truth from capture through workspace artifact, media metadata, timeline import, preview, and export. Adds stable persisted capture metadata with migration for legacy media.
- Procedural backgrounds for the Video Editor with mesh gradients (4-corner bilinear with smoothness, rotation, scale and offset) and repeatable patterns (dots, grid, stripes, checker) rendered deterministically at any resolution and frame. GPU fragment path is used for large tiles with exact CPU canvas fallback; preview and export share the same `CanvasStackCompositor` path so pixels are identical.
- Typed persisted `background` item model (`background` item kind, `ProceduralBackground` union) with migration 4, normalization/clamping, clone-safe deep copy and keyframe-compatible parameters (`backgroundRotation`, `backgroundScale`, `backgroundOffsetX/Y`, `backgroundSmoothness`, `backgroundDensity`, `backgroundForegroundOpacity`) resolved through the existing animated-properties seam and undo history.
- Eight built-in presets (Sunset/Ocean/Forest/Neon mesh + Dots/Grid/Stripes/Checker) stored immutably and cloned on apply; no mutable shared preset state and no bespoke parallel renderer.
- Compact responsive inspector and creation UI using shared primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Slider`, `AppSelect`, `Label`, `Tabs`): preset grid, kind switch, color pickers, pattern selectors, density/opacity/rotation/scale/offset sliders. Honest alpha/blend via item `transform.opacity` and `blendMode` on the shared stack; accessible labels, keyboard focus, visible focus ring, and 320px layout verified in Chromium.
- Native concise copy for all ten editor locales (`en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `pt`, `pt-BR`, `tr`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh`) for the new panel and controls.

### Changed

- Preview and export audio graphs now apply the shared effect chain after EQ and before the mixer, preserving existing EQ, pitch, fades, and ducking and without creating extra AudioContexts.
- Recording setup shows honest capability states for screen, cursor, and system audio and never claims an audio stream exists merely because requested. Cancellation and track teardown are clean and bounded.

### Fixed

- Preview and export use actual captured tracks without duplicating or dropping audio; inactive system audio is reported as unavailable rather than presented as present.

## [4.3.2] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Accept current npm metadata output when verifying a clean n8n community-node install.

## [4.3.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

## [4.3.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Mobile idea capture can now turn a rough note into one editable post with destination-specific renditions, then send the reviewed result to the workspace's next queue slot. Manual writing and scheduling remain available when AI is disabled.
- Failed publications can now be dismissed without deleting their delivery history and restored immediately with Undo from mobile or web.

### Fixed

- Android scheduling now opens the date and time steps reliably, calendar weeks always show all seven days, and composer drawers stay usable above the keyboard.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Rolling and ripple edits now show a live 2-up OUT/IN comparison in the program monitor while dragging. The overlay is owned by the timeline gesture, publishes only from the snapped and validated plan, and clears on commit, Escape, pointer cancel, destroy, and tool changes. It reuses PreviewLayer and the existing decoder prewarm, proxy, and filmstrip path without a second owner, handles gaps, speed, reverse, sourceStart/sourceEnd/sourceFps, linked audio-to-visual companions, and image/composition/Lottie sources, and labels OUT, IN, and GAP with high-contrast timecodes that remain usable at 320 px without hiding export or quality failures. Slip shows new IN/OUT with baseline IN/OUT corners; slide shows the left OUT and right IN at the new cut with their pre-drag baselines as corner thumbnails, both rendered as fitted virtual items so the compared frame is always visible and aspect-correct.
- Focused 2D composition timeline for Motion workspace. When a `composite-2d` composition is active the footer shows a single dedicated surface instead of stacking. The compact layout keeps layer names, in/out work area and FPS header always visible, uses a shared row model so sidebar labels and the scrollable bar/keyframe lanes stay aligned, and collapses to a single column below 640px without widening a 320px page. Scrubbing the ruler seeks via the shared clock without marking the project dirty or calling autosave.
- Layer rows expose Position, Scale and Anchor as localized vector lanes. Diamonds are rendered in the scroll surface, culled via the shared timeline viewport, and use typed vector helpers without `as any`. Diamonds are interactive buttons wired to the shared `keyframeSelectionStore`; dragging a diamond repositions its frame through atomic keyframe actions with a single undo and restores on Escape or pointercancel.
- Layer bars support pointer move and start/end trim with edge detection, adaptive snapping via shared snap targets, a single commit/undo on release, Escape/pointercancel restore, locked-track guards, and no autosave while drafting. Drafts reuse `planLinkedMoveGesture` and `planTrimGesture` instead of reimplementing semantics.
- Transform parenting uses a pick-whip that highlights valid layer rows, validates only via `itemById` (no track ID casts), and shows localized cycle/duplicate errors. A successful link or detach clears to a localized success status (“Parent linked”/“Parent removed”), records exactly one undo, and cleans window listeners on destroy.
- In/out handles snapshot once, draft via raw setters, add exactly one undo only if the range actually changed, and restore on pointercancel.
- Edit by Transcript now supports Selection and Project scope, contiguous drag and Shift selection, active-word tracking, Backspace staging, and Ctrl or Command+Enter commit. Transcript tokens keep exact timeline ownership across repeated source uses and linked A/V pairs, while one undoable cut removes the selected phrase and its internal pauses without trimming another use of the same media.
- Transcript Copy and Cut now carry source-trimmed media, linked audio, effects, and timing gaps into the shared timeline clipboard. Paste keeps multi-track alignment, shifts the group past collisions, creates independent links and origins, and lands as one undo step. Reversed clips map transcript ranges back to ascending timeline frames without losing their source span.
- Auto-captions now queue multiple clips, show per-clip progress and queue position, and share one decode across repeated placements of the same source window. Retranscription replaces duplicate generated captions in one undo step, cancellation stays clip-owned, and results cannot attach after the source clip changes or disappears. Generated captions split with their exact source clip, while reverse playback keeps word order, filler removal, and transcript edits mapped to the correct source seconds.
- Screen, camera, and microphone captures now stay linked after insertion. Recorder chunks commit to local storage as they arrive, and a versioned session manifest restores flushed tracks with their original offsets after a tab or browser failure. Recovery remains available until the user adds, downloads, or removes it, and another live recording tab keeps ownership of its active session.
- Recording setup now keeps source, device, countdown, duration, video quality, camera direction, and microphone processing choices across sessions. Screen and camera capture support 720p, 1080p, or 4K at 24, 30, or 60 fps with matching encoder bitrates and storage estimates. A live input meter confirms microphone activity while recording.
- Local voice generation now exposes Supertonic laugh, breath, and sigh tags, remembers the chosen engine, and keeps each preview tied to the text clip that requested it. Older previews can no longer link to a newer text selection by mistake.
- Mixer tracks and the master bus now have separate six-band parametric EQ controls. Their settings persist with projects and compositions, remain undoable, apply in the same order during live preview and export, and correctly disable Quick Cut when audio must be rendered.
- Text items in the focused 2D composition timeline now show typed In, Loop and Out bands derived from the real `textMotion` spec via the shared `getTextMotionTimelineBands` math (including `segmentTextUnits` unit counts, stagger, and half-clip clamping, exact to FreeCut). Bands are rendered in both the sticky layer list and the scrollable lane, culled via the shared viewport, with localized preset and slot labels, duration and unit suffixes, and offset metadata.
- In and Out band bodies drag to change `offsetFrames` from the clip edge; Loop bodies do not offer offset. Band edges drag to change `durationFrames` (In right edge, Out left edge, Loop right handle). Loop duration edits do not create a false offset. All drags use `beginTextMotionEdit` / `updateTextMotionLive` / `commitTextMotionEdit` with a single undo per gesture, live preview via the shared store, `isTrackEffectivelyLocked` group-lock guards, pointer capture with `lostpointercapture` handling, a single stored cleanup for `pointermove` / `up` / `cancel` / `keydown` / `lostcapture` called on every terminal path and onDestroy, Escape and pointercancel restore the exact snapshot even before the 3px threshold, and `pointercancel`/`lostcapture`/`unmount` do not synthesize PointerEvent. No-op drags (clamped to start) add no undo and do not call `onedit`.
- Advertise the hosted API, authentication flow, Markdown pages, sitemap, and OpenAPI contract through an RFC 9727 API catalog, `/auth.md`, and homepage HTTP Link headers.
- Meme Maker now uses OpenPost's own fast, watermark-free renderer, a full built-in template catalog, a larger editing workbench, and template-specific AI guidance.
- Added the official `@getopenpost/n8n-nodes-openpost` package with importable workspace-listing and draft-creation workflows.
- Added a dedicated n8n CI gate for generated contracts, types, tests, lint, builds, package loading, npm payload inspection, and package version discipline.
- Video Editor preview and export now share one WebGL2 compositor and a bounded GPU texture/framebuffer pool. The ping-pong targets reuse exact-size allocations across resize cycles, clear stale pixels, stay isolated per GL context, cap at 96 MB/8 entries, and release on device loss/dispose without leaking ImageBitmap or OffscreenCanvas. Transition branches no longer detach from their canvases on parent resize, and disposing one live stack does not invalidate another. Real Chromium WebGL2 tests cover reuse, resize, context separation, dispose, transition pixel regression, and a layered-timeline allocation benchmark proving second-frame reuse.
- Animated GIF and animated WebP imports now play as real animations instead of frozen first frames. Import probes the true composited frame count, loop duration, and effective frame rate, inserts span one full animation loop, a cancellable worker extracts every frame with exact per-frame container delays into a bounded memory cache with OPFS persistence, and the timeline filmstrip, live preview (including speed and reverse), still capture, and full or range export all read the exact same decoded frames with looping playback.
- The Video Editor now has persisted Edit, Color, and Motion workspaces that keep the same project, playhead, selection, program monitor, and timeline while changing the tools around them. Color uses one fitted dock for grading, effects, and scopes; Motion focuses transforms, presets, text motion, keyframes, property links, and expressions.
- Motion can now create and enter focused 2D compositions, return to the parent sequence, add non-rendering controllers, and attach or detach transform parents. Animated parent chains keep their pose across canvas edits, deletion, compound boundaries, duplication, and project cloning, share cycle guards with property links, and resolve the same way in preview and export.
- Motion compositions now reuse full layer-group controls and can publish plain text and solid text or shape colors. Every placed instance gets independent resettable overrides without changing the source, with matching nested live preview and export output.
- Video Editor ASCII and Paper halftone effects now include their full typed control surfaces and render in both preview and export.
- GPU effects now render on image, text, and subtitle clips as well as video, with one text raster path shared by preview and export.
- The full 54-effect FreeCut GPU catalog now runs in OpenPost, including exact HQ pixel sort and complete direction/order controls for the streak variant.
- Timed adjustment layers now apply ordered CSS and GPU effects to every active visual clip below them in preview and export.
- All 25 clip blend modes now composite against the finished layers below in live preview and export, with one shared GPU stack and an exact CPU fallback.
- A full keyframe value graph now exposes sampled easing curves, direct Bezier handles, shared multi-key selection and movement, snapping, zoom, pan, fit, Alt duplication, keyboard edits, and transition-safe ranges.
- The full dope sheet now supports cross-row marquee and Shift selection, atomic multi-key retime and Alt duplication, keyboard edits, property locks and filters, normalized copy/cut/paste, and reusable cubic or spring easing presets.
- The color workspace now adds RGB Parade, frame-aware auto balance, loupe-based white/black/white point pickers, multi-clip grade copy/paste, saved grade presets, and preview-only before/after or draggable split comparison.
- The Color workspace now includes a whole-project navigator with media thumbnails, compact visual track lanes, markers, in/out range, and a preview-only scrub path that selects clips and commits the exact release frame without adding undo history.
- On-canvas editing now includes rotated source-pixel crop handles, pose-preserving anchor moves, scaled direct text editing, and editable position motion paths with versioned vector keys, smooth or split spatial Bezier handles, keyboard control, cancellation, transition guards, and atomic undo.
- The on-canvas transform gizmo now adds eight rotation-aware edge and corner handles, center or opposite-side scaling, media aspect-ratio control, snapped or free rotation, large touch targets, and precise keyboard edits.
- The complete 44-effect FreeCut transition catalog now includes searchable grouped controls, placement, easing, direction, effect parameters, timeline selection and resizing, exact endpoint timing, undo, and matching preview/export rendering through lazy WebGPU pipelines with Canvas2D fallbacks.
- Transition audio now uses full cut-centered source-handle overlap and sample-level equal-power curves in preview, full export, and range export, while synced audio companions suppress duplicate embedded video audio.
- Projects now support reusable sequences and compound clips with ordered tabs, per-sequence view and undo state, cycle-safe nesting, source-window-correct dissolve, and recursive visual/audio preview and export. Media-pool cards render cached frames from the real nested compositor, create deep independent duplicates, and confirm the exact root and nested reference impact before undoable deletion.
- The Scene Browser now detects cuts off the main thread, stores lazy thumbnails and Lab palettes, captions scenes with local LFM, indexes text and images with MiniLM and CLIP, ranks keyword, semantic, color, and palette searches, and inserts exact source ranges by button or drag with progress, cancellation, and undo.
- Local auto-captions now use a complete Parakeet and Whisper engine registry with model and language controls, safe fallback, streamed decode, warm worker reuse, staged download and inference progress, cancellation, source-window and playback-speed mapping, and removable browser model caches.
- Local voice generation now matches FreeCut with Kokoro, Supertonic 3, and MOSS Nano, all engine voices and language controls, real progress and cancellation, reusable previews, one-time media-pool saves, and atomic insertion at the playhead. OpenPost also pins the Supertonic and MOSS revisions, verifies resumable MOSS files, falls back from unavailable WebGPU adapters, and allows MOSS speed adjustment.
- The complete Video Editor now ships in English, Spanish, French, German, European and Brazilian Portuguese, Turkish, Japanese, Korean, and Simplified Chinese, with native language labels and strict catalog and placeholder checks.
- Shape clips now include rectangle, circle, ellipse, triangle, star, polygon, and heart presets with solid or linear fills, strokes, rounded geometry, direct transforms, effects, blending, nested composition support, and one shared preview/export renderer.
- Shape strokes now support arc-length trim ranges, cyclic offsets, open-path wrapping, animated variable-width start and end tapers, cap-aware outlines, bounded project loading, and the same pixels in preview and export.
- The Video Editor pen tool now draws open or closed Bezier paths with click-or-drag knots, exact curve-preserving point insertion, corner and continuous tangents, direct point and handle editing, keyboard controls, and automatic bounds fitting.
- Shape clips can now act as hard clip or feathered alpha masks with opacity and inversion. Masks affect only lower tracks and render through the same animated compositor in live preview, transitions, nested sequences, still capture, and export; path masks reuse the full Bezier editor and always stay closed.
- Visual clips now support four-point corner pinning with direct canvas handles, keyboard nudges, exact local-pixel controls, size-stable offsets, and the same projective mesh in live preview, masks, transitions, nested sequences, still capture, and export.
- Lottie JSON and dotLottie archives now import as frame-accurate clips with validated native timing, generated thumbnails, speed, reverse, loop and ping-pong modes, source-frame segments, named markers, and one deterministic renderer shared by live preview, nested sequences, still capture, and export.
- The Video Editor now browses featured, popular, recent, and searched public LottieFiles animations with live previews, cancellation, pagination, safe bounded imports, visible license guidance, and persisted creator and license details.
- The Video Editor now groups shapes, stock, stickers, and Lottie under one Assets panel. It searches configured Pexels, Unsplash, and Pixabay sources, enforces streamed import limits, keeps creator and license details, and places stock at the playhead. A lazy local catalog adds 3,145 transparent Microsoft Fluent Emoji stickers with search, reuse, direct insertion, and stored MIT provenance.
- Lottie template clips now expose bundled animation and theme pickers, author text and color controls, grouped palettes, and native scalar or two-axis slots, with the same cached source patch used by preview and export.
- The media pool now opens an independent source monitor for image, audio, video, and Lottie assets, with exact in/out marks, range dragging and playback, timecode or frame display, active-track V/A patching, and keyboard editing.
- Source insert and overwrite edits now place linked native-frame ranges at the playhead, convert frame rates, create requested tracks, preserve surrounding material and split Lottie phase, reject locked targets, and undo as one action.
- Video and audio clips now support exact reverse playback with linked undoable controls, mirrored timeline filmstrips and waveforms, reversed PCM monitoring and export, frame-accurate video export, and a shared cancellable 720p preview conform cached by source fingerprint.
- Continuous split siblings can now be joined from the timeline toolbar or with Shift+J, including linked A/V clips, reversed source windows, transition repair, locked-track guards, and one-step undo.
- Video clips can now insert an exact native-resolution two-second freeze frame from the timeline toolbar or Shift+F, with reversed-source mapping, animated visual-state capture, transition repair, race-safe media cleanup, and one-step undo.
- Timeline ruler scrubbing now plays exact 45 ms audio grains with a persisted toggle, pointer and keyboard control, reverse and nested-composition mapping, mute and solo rules, linked A/V de-duplication, stale-seek dropping, and a decoded Web Audio fallback.
- Timeline tracks now resize from 48 to 140 pixels by pointer or keyboard, support Alt resize-all and double-click reset, cancel cleanly with Escape, persist with the project, scroll vertically, and undo each completed gesture in one step.
- Project markers now render on the ruler with names and colors, drag or move by keyboard, edit label/frame/color, jump with controls or bracket shortcuts, delete with Shift+M, and participate correctly in snapshot undo and redo.
- Timeline zoom now matches FreeCut with a logarithmic control, pointer-anchored coalesced wheel zoom, playhead-anchored buttons, fit and 100% controls, and the full keyboard shortcut set.
- Hovering the timeline now skims the program monitor through a separate ghost playhead and timecode without moving the edit position or seeking audio. Pointer work is coalesced to one update per animation frame and stops during playback, touch input, zoom, dialogs, and edit gestures.
- All 36 supported Video Editor commands now use one customizable shortcut catalog with browser-local persistence, physical-key capture, command and browser conflict checks, unassign and reset controls, search and filters, and versioned OpenPost or matching FreeCut preset import and export.
- Selected clips can clear all animation or one property with Shift+A or the timeline toolbar. The confirmation reports the exact key count, keeps locked tracks unchanged, and records the whole multi-clip edit as one undo step.
- Canvas move and resize gestures now snap to canvas edges, centers, quarter positions, and neighboring layer bounds with screen-stable hysteresis, localized live guides, rotation-aware bounds, and Alt bypass. The timeline magnet controls both timeline and canvas snapping.
- Interface sounds are now opt-in with persisted volume and Signature, Velvet, or Crisp themes. Editor cues stop during preview playback, stay out of exports, and give one result cue for selection, split, delete, effect, snap, linked-selection, skimming, workspace, and track-state actions.
- Preview diagnostics now report measured frame and renderer data, adaptive quality, proxy state, GPU fallbacks, and skipped preview frames. Optional overlays stay local to the browser, while copied reports omit project names, clip labels, media IDs, and file paths.
- ProRes footage now imports with real metadata and thumbnails, prepares a playable compatibility proxy with visible progress, remains viewable at Full preview quality, supports source-monitor audio, filmstrips, scene tools, freeze frames, and exports from the original full-quality source.
- AC-3 and E-AC-3 audio now decode through a lazy worker-safe codec in source and timeline preview, waveforms, silence analysis, transcription, processed media, and export. DTS and TrueHD imports now name the codec and require an explicit choice before importing the video with a silent audio track.
- Delete now leaves an intentional gap, while Ctrl or Command + Delete performs a sync-lock-aware ripple delete across linked tracks with one undo step.
- Effect stacks now support ordered move controls, default-aware reset, bypass and enable, and removal across compatible multi-clip selections with one undo step per action.
- The searchable effect picker now shows real shader-backed previews for every GPU effect plus CSS previews, with full-strength posters, hover sweeps, reduced-motion support, and lazy rendering inside the picker viewport.
- The effect picker now includes FreeCut's nine built-in effect stacks and user-saved full-stack presets, preserving parameters and bypass state across preview, drag, atomic multi-clip apply, update, and deletion.
- GPU effect parameters now support FreeCut-compatible numeric and color keyframes, per-parameter auto-key controls, perceptual color interpolation, shared preview and export output, and automatic cleanup when an effect is removed.
- GPU effect keyframe lanes now follow FreeCut's parameter metadata: temporal rate controls stay static while pixel-sort length remains animatable.
- The seven center-based GPU effects now have a direct one-point canvas editor with source-accurate crop, transform, flip, rotation, parent-motion, and corner-pin mapping, live preview, paired keyframe writes, keyboard control, locked-track guards, and clean cancellation.
- Live histogram, waveform, RGB Parade, and vectorscope views now use FreeCut's exact WebGPU compute and phosphor-rendering path with high-DPI output, channel modes, direct graded-canvas uploads, playback-aware sampling, device-loss recovery, and an aligned BT.709 CPU fallback.
- The clip inspector now includes all 20 FreeCut Entrance, Exit, and Emphasis motion presets with animated previews, exact generator timing and easing, duration, intensity, and multi-clip stagger controls, region-scoped Replace and collision-safe Add modes, coupled position support, transition-wide safety, and one-step undo.
- Float drift, sway, breath pulse, spin, and micro shake now stay live as compact procedural motion records with deterministic preview and export output, per-channel gains, multi-clip staggering, editable speed and intensity, reduced-motion thumbnails, and coalesced undo while tuning.
- Live motion can now be baked into adaptive editable keyframes across a whole selection with transition-safe atomic undo, while an explicit cleanup removes animation parked past trimmed clip bounds without changing the final visible pose.
- Projects now carry a searchable saved-animation library that preserves scalar and coupled motion, easing and spatial handles, same-type effect instances, and live behaviors, with playhead apply, optional retiming, Replace/Add semantics, compatibility checks, confirmed deletion, and atomic multi-clip undo.
- Text clips now support all 17 FreeCut In, Out, and Loop text-motion presets with character, word, line, and whole-clip units, deterministic ordering, live stagger, duration, and intensity controls, saved-animation reuse, and matching preview and export rendering.
- Visual properties now support cycle-safe direct links with frame offsets and a bounded expression editor with scalar or vector math, `prop()` references, live validation, link and reference pick whips, duplicate-group remapping, undo, and matching preview and export evaluation.
- Position, scale, and anchor animation now support coupled vector lanes or separate X/Y tracks, safe value-preserving conversion, exact per-frame baking for mismatched and spatial timing, percentage scale curves, and the same editable result across presets, preview, and export.
- Pen and mask paths now animate every point and Bezier handle through topology-locked scalar lanes, with selected or all-point keying, Shift multi-selection, focused or complete timeline rows, saved-animation reuse, and matching preview and export geometry.
- Text clips now include all 13 current FreeCut templates, reversible one-, two-, and three-span copy layouts, per-span typography, template scaling, content-fit backgrounds, real bundled fonts, wrapped mixed-style lines, and one raster layout shared by preview and export.
- The text inspector now edits full block typography, including horizontal and vertical alignment, padding, background, stroke, shadow, font metrics, and colors, while base property edits remain available when the playhead sits outside the selected clip.
- Caption clips now include the exact Netflix, YouTube, Bold Yellow, Outlined, and TikTok recipes with bundled fonts, canvas-relative placement, one-step undo, compact previews, and direct style controls.
- Subtitle cues now parse common SRT, VTT, and ASS formatting, hide markup during transcript edits, preserve cue alignment and Bold, Italic, and Underline flags through word edits, and render the same mixed-font raster in preview and export.
- Inline text now measures and paints each styled run with its own font metrics and breaks overlong words without losing span styling.
- Caption clips linked to the same source can now consolidate into one editable subtitle item with exact absolute cue timing, shared styling, linked groups, locked-track safety, and one-step undo.
- MKV, MKA, and WebM media now expose embedded UTF-8, WebVTT, ASS, and SSA subtitle tracks with streaming scan progress, cancellation, source-fingerprinted caching, default and forced track selection, and atomic trim- and speed-aware timeline insertion.
- Export preflight now checks the exact range, visible or audible content, source readiness, device codec support, subtitle compatibility, expected duration, and output size before rendering. It blocks unsafe jobs, explains fixes, and passes the checked frame range to the renderer.
- Render jobs can now be queued from frozen timeline, nested-sequence, range, and output settings. The project queue persists locally, runs one job at a time, supports pause, reorder, cancel, retry, and clear controls, and restores interrupted work in a paused state.
- Queued exports can now split the active range at timeline markers or into fixed 10, 30, or 60 second jobs. Segment batches share one frozen timeline snapshot, keep exact frame bounds and remainder frames, and can turn an output above the in-memory limit into safe smaller renders.
- The Exports dialog now lists project files saved in the local workspace, refreshes after queued renders finish, downloads the exact saved file, and confirms permanent deletion with clear loading, empty, missing-file, and retry states.
- Immediate and queued video or audio exports now show preparing, mixing, frame rendering, encoding, and file-finalization phases with percent, frame, and elapsed-time counters, plus direct cancellation.
- Full video exports now prefer a dedicated render worker, keep progress and cancellation live, and fall back to the main thread only for known browser or worker limits. Workers return bytes while the main thread saves each output once.
- Heavy timeline footage now prepares one background proxy at a time, switches preview visuals to the smaller local file without losing source audio, and keeps Full-quality preview and every export on the original source.
- Stalled proxy scrubs now show the nearest cached filmstrip frame after a short delay and replace it as soon as the exact decoded frame settles.
- Auto preview now lowers actual GPU and stacked-canvas resolution after sustained missed frame budgets, recovers in stable playback, and predecodes exact upcoming clip, transition-handle, and recursively nested composition boundary frames in a serialized worker so new visuals appear without a cold decoder pause. The planner honors nested source trims, speed, hidden tracks, and cycle guards while retaining only the bounded nearest targets. The quality menu shows the active render percentage while adapted.
- Untouched single-source exports now use a strict keyframe-aligned fast-copy path across MP4, MOV, WebM, and MKV. It preserves the original encoded video and audio packet payloads, skips encoder checks, works in queued and shortcut exports, reports the path before export, and falls back to the full renderer for any visual, audio, subtitle, transition, codec, size, or source mismatch.
- Speech cleanup now reviews filler words, phrases, signal silence, and transcript gaps before editing. A local CLAP audio model ranks transcript matches by confidence, leaves low-confidence words unchecked, reports model and scoring progress, falls back to explicit review when audio is unavailable, and unloads through shared model controls. Cleanup also supports presets, custom detection lists, exact cut totals, audition, selection, cancellation, caption retiming, and one locked-track-safe, sync-lock-aware ripple undo.
- Transcript editing can now stage words without changing the timeline, show exact struck-through words and duration, restore any selection, clear the review, and commit every staged source-time span as one caption-aware ripple edit and one undo step.
- Transcript search now finds exact phrases as they are typed, falls back to bounded typo-tolerant word matches only when exact search fails, highlights every result, and jumps between timed words from a compact keyboard-friendly control.
- Editor settings now persist undo depth, snapping, timeline detail, local transcription defaults, and an optional 5 to 30 minute safety save. OpenPost still saves completed edits after 800 ms, while the safety timer catches dirty work during long idle sessions without overlapping an active write. The Storage section prepares proxies, clears only rebuildable waveform and filmstrip data, regenerates thumbnails, removes session proxies, and manages local models without touching source media, edits, or exports.
- The project media panel now imports direct URLs, GIFs, and safe SVG files; searches, filters, sorts, and groups assets; and shows codec, size, storage, tag, and attribution details without leaving the editor.
- Projects now detect unavailable media on open, restore expired file access, relink moved sources with fresh metadata and previews, and recover orphaned timeline clips through safe automatic or manual replacements with locked-track checks and atomic undo.
- The project browser now shows cover images, duration, resolution, aspect ratio, and frame rate; searches, filters, and sorts in either direction; supports range and keyboard multi-selection with one bulk action; renames projects; and creates deep duplicates. Its Trash section restores projects, deletes one or all projects with shared-media checks, reports partial cleanup, and removes entries older than 30 days. Duplicates preserve media links and cover art while remapping timeline, caption, effect, keyframe, expression, transition, and saved-animation IDs.
- Project files now upgrade through an ordered, append-only schema registry. OpenPost writes a legacy project backup with media links, cover art, and external folder access before it persists the new document, and it leaves projects from newer editor versions untouched.
- Projects can now export and import checksummed `.openpost.json` snapshots. Imports migrate old projects, reject newer schemas, remap project IDs, match available media without copying it, keep missing sources recoverable, and roll back failed writes.
- Projects can now travel as `.openpost.zip` bundles with their source media, saved animations, and cover image. Export streams bytes to disk with live progress, cancellation, and no media recompression; import verifies every path, size, and SHA-256 hash before it remaps IDs, reuses safe local media, or commits the project, and cancellation removes partial files.
- Color grading now includes a direct Master, Red, Green, and Blue curves graph with arbitrary control points, large touch targets, precise keyboard edits, live preview, channel reset, and one-step undo across compatible selected clips. Preview and export share the same exact 256-sample GPU lookup texture.
- Background media work now stays visible in one compact project footer across panel changes. It combines real import, proxy, filmstrip, waveform, scene-analysis, transcription, voice-generation, and reverse-preview progress, expands into per-job stages and counters, and offers cancellation only when the worker can stop safely.
- Long timeline filmstrips now fill the visible clip with stable, viewport-sized tiles, decode visible source seconds before background samples, stop work when clips leave the viewport, and transfer display bitmaps before JPEG cache writes finish.
- Long and dense timelines now mount only a bounded viewport slice, collapse compact clips into interactive density buckets, preserve geometry-based marquee selection across unmounted clips, and add a project navigator with direct pan and edge zoom. Root caps, animation-frame-coalesced scroll work, keyboard control, coarse-pointer handles, and clean cancellation keep 30,000-clip projects responsive without widening a 320 px page.
- Timeline waveforms now render for audio-only clips as well as videos, stream visible peak chunks during long decodes, preserve FreeCut's 500-sample-per-second detail in a bounded cache, cancel safely, and replace old low-resolution persisted peaks. Incremental peak indexing and one path calculation per clip keep long-source redraws bounded. Real Chromium covers worker decoding and audio timeline rendering.
- Media-pool clips and nested sequences now drag to an exact timeline track and frame with snapping, edge auto-scroll, compatible-row and collision rejection, linked visual and audio ghosts, and one-step insertion. The same honest placement mode supports touch and keyboard input without widening a 320 px page.
- Track push/pull now shifts every clip at or after a chosen cut across all tracks with a live frame-coalesced preview, magnetic snapping, the tightest safe left clamp, keyboard and touch input, clean cancellation, transition repair, and one-step undo. Hidden clips stay in sync, while any affected locked track blocks the whole edit instead of moving locked content.
- Multi-selected visual clips now move, scale, rotate, align to every canvas edge or center, and distribute by equal visual gaps through one compact on-canvas control. Rotated custom anchors, transform parents, snapping, keyframes, locks, cancellation, keyboard input, touch targets, and one-step rollback-safe undo all share the same preview and saved transform truth.
- The timeline now records voiceover takes while playback runs, with microphone selection, live levels, narration processing, exact mute restoration, pause and resume, timing offset, seek locking, a live range overlay, project-switch cleanup, and one-step insertion on a named audio track.
- Screen, camera, and microphone recording now produces separate synchronized artifacts with measured start offsets, device selection, optional system audio, countdown, live size counters, and local-space preflight. Ordered OPFS scratch writes keep long captures off the heap, a bounded fallback stops cleanly before memory can grow without limit, partial files stay downloadable after insertion failure, and successful timeline insertion rolls back every imported artifact if any later step fails.
- Timeline tracks now form one-level groups with inherited visibility, lock, mute, and solo behavior across editing, preview, and export. Groups support collapse, rename, block-safe reorder, undoable creation, safe ungrouping, and a separate confirmed action for removing grouped tracks and clips.
- Selected visual clips now arrange into automatic grids, rows, columns, picture-in-picture, focus-and-sidebar, or fixed grids through a live preview with transition-chain cells, reorder controls, canvas spacing, saved presets, grouped-lock safety, active-sequence sizing, and one-step undo.
- Project video can now create first-class 2x Anime4K upscales for live action, animation, or 3D footage and 2x through 8x RIFE frame-interpolated copies. Both tools serialize GPU work, prefer WebGPU with a WASM fallback, stream MP4 output through local scratch storage, copy compatible audio without re-encoding, show stages, bytes, progress, ETA, and cancellation, and import the playable result back into the project media library.
- Save Frame and Freeze Frame now verify their rendered pixels, create small media-library thumbnails, persist complete workspace metadata, and roll back partial writes before exposing the generated still to the project.
- The Video Editor can now create 2 to 120 second instrumental tracks locally with ACE-Step 1.5 XL Turbo, using standard or high-precision browser models. For 2 to 9 second stingers it renders the model's 10-second minimum once, then trims the PCM WAV at an exact sample frame without re-encoding. It shows the full first-run size and origin quota before downloading, serializes the GPU with video enhancement jobs, reports byte and inference progress, cancels cleanly, manages cached OPFS model data, previews each WAV, and saves or inserts it at the playhead without duplicating media.
- ACE-Step storage checks now count only the assets used by the Turbo generation path. Standard and High first-use totals, progress, cache readiness, and quota preflight no longer include the unused semantic-code detokenizer.
- Clip properties now include playhead-aware anchor and transform values, horizontal and vertical flip, exact linked A/V speed retiming, visual and audio fades, and -60 dB to +12 dB gain. Preview and export share the same fade curves, linked edits stay atomic, and retimed keyframes keep their timing.
- Clip audio now preserves pitch across 0.1x to 10x speed changes, adds independent semitone and cent tuning, shaped fades, 15 EQ presets, and a complete six-band parametric EQ. Top-level and nested preview use a low-latency SoundTouch worklet and native Web Audio filters, while export applies the same phase-coherent stereo stretch and EQ without allowing the fast-copy path to skip audible edits.
- Long video and audio exports now keep decode, time-stretch, pitch, EQ, sample-rate conversion, automation, and mixdown in fixed five-second windows while preserving one continuous DSP state across every boundary. Final mux bytes stream to local scratch storage instead of growing one whole-file heap buffer, cancellation removes partial output, stale scratch expires automatically, video-only clips no longer create false audio failures, and decode errors stop the export instead of publishing missing sound.
- The timeline now opens a compact audio mixer with per-track and master faders, mute and solo, true stereo meters, peak hold, and clipping feedback. One shared Web Audio bus graph keeps preview routing exact, while root and nested master settings persist through undo, project saves, direct exports, queued exports, and smart-copy checks.
- Local model storage now tracks and unloads every resident transcription, search, caption, voice, music, interpolation, and upscaling runtime. Removing a model first releases its worker or sessions, concurrent clears share one operation, active work settles cleanly, and partial cache failures stay visible.
- The Edit workspace now uses compact Assets, Program, and Edit panes below desktop width, keeps the program monitor and inspector usable down to 320 px, and contains wide timeline controls inside their own scroller instead of widening the page.
- Editing workspace folders can now be added, switched, and removed from one compact project-browser control. The active folder stays clear, permission loss returns to the named reconnect flow, and switching refreshes the project list without a stale workspace view.
- Motion now supports FreeCut-parity additive MotionAnimationLayers: durable typed layers with add and multiply blending evaluated after base keyframes and before procedural modifiers, independent enable and disable, named independently removable layers, preset-as-layer application with merge semantics, multi-selection one-step undo, preview and export parity through the shared evaluator, saved-animation capture with cloned layers, and a focused accessible Motion workspace UI with 44 px phone targets, 320 px narrow-width proof, and i18n across 10 locales. Each preset can be added as a non-destructive layer without touching authored diamonds, baked later into keyframes, or removed without affecting base animation or live modifiers. Direct canvas moves, resizes, and rotations now remove active layer and procedural contributions before writing the editable base, so a gesture cannot double-count live motion.
- Video Editor now has a first-class persisted `ai-captions` caption source distinct from `transcript`, `subtitle-import`, and `embedded-subtitles`. Local scene analysis output (LFM vision model via the existing `sceneCaptionProvider` / `analyzeSceneContent` stack, no new model layer) creates an editable subtitle layer without replacing transcript captions. Captions derive placement and width from the actual project canvas (16:9, 1:1, 9:16) and share preview and burn/sidecar/embedded export through the common subtitle pipeline, with correction in the transcript panel, atomic undo, and repeat-run replacement of only its own previous `ai-captions` item. The timeline tools panel now exposes direct AI caption entry with progress, cancel, and error states through shared `mediaTasks` and shared UI primitives, with responsive 44px targets, 320/390 and dark-theme Chromium coverage, and serialised per-clip AI jobs that guard rapid repeats and shared scene-worker contention.
- FreeCut 4d62e80 J/K/L shuttle parity across program and source monitors with editable `SHUTTLE_FORWARD` (`l`), `SHUTTLE_REVERSE` (`j`), and `SHUTTLE_PAUSE` (`k`) commands, saved remaps, repeat suppression, editable-field guards, and localized labels in all ten editor locales.

### Fixed

- Made clean frontend test runs generate SvelteKit's ignored configuration before Vitest starts, so fresh Linux release candidates no longer fail during dependency optimization.
- Kept Android release builds reproducible by aligning the standalone app with the current Expo SDK 57 patch set and resolving one shared linking module across all native packages.
- Updated ZIP extraction used by local AI model tooling to the patched release that rejects crafted archives with abusive memory sizes.
- Edit comparison frame mapping is covered by pure tests for gaps, speed, reverse, sourceFps, linked companions, images/compositions, and timecodes, plus Chromium pointer tests that drive real timeline drags for rolling, ripple, slip, and slide, verify baseline-vs-dynamic distinction, audio-linked visual resolution, cancellation cleanup, single undo entries, absence of URL leaks, and 320 px layout.
- Composition fps header no longer hardcodes 30 due to missing parentheses.
- Keyboard Delete/Arrow nudge now works from the focusable, correctly named timeline region (`role="region"` with `aria-label`) as well as the window, with proper focus and a single undo entry.
- Motion gestures now share one pointer session with exact ownership, frame-coalesced previews, outside-release commits, and Escape, capture-loss, supersession, and destroy cancellation. Media drops use real pool metadata and exact lanes; work-area trims preserve source bounds; published controls, property links, all compositor blend modes, and program-monitor ghost scrubbing use their canonical runtime paths. Variable-height sidebar virtualization keeps large compositions bounded while preserving expanded rows, and source-aware timing edits, inherited locks, and atomic undo now cover every inline edit.
- Text motion band math now matches `references/freecut/src/shared/timeline/text-motion-timeline.ts` exactly, with pure tests for In/Out/Loop placement, half-clip clamping, and max offset.
- Filler, silence, and transcript range removal now repair generated captions once from their source timing instead of first splitting the caption item through the normal clip-split hook. Linked video and audio still ripple together, later caption words keep their timing, and one undo restores the full edit.
- Quick Cut now uses direct English labels for its empty state, in/out marks, preview, and export actions. Imported projects also stay within 320 px by shrinking grid tracks, truncating long source names, and stacking per-segment export controls on phones.
- Every built-in transition now reaches exact outgoing and incoming endpoint pixels in its Canvas2D path. Spiral and X wipes no longer cut a one-pixel seam at zero progress, shape and iris apertures cannot leave edge fragments at completion, sparkle glow ends cleanly, and the Chromatic, Liquid Distort, Glitch, and Pixelate fallbacks retain their direction and visual character instead of collapsing to a plain crossfade or hard cut.
- Render queues now save live phase and frame progress through bounded, ordered workspace writes, preserve the latest progress document after a crash, and flush the correct project before a workspace switch or editor close.
- Video Editor workspace tabs, mobile pane controls, canvas tools, timeline markers, trim edges, transition edges, audio gain lines, and track resize handles now keep 44 px interaction targets on phones and coarse pointers without enlarging desktop editing chrome. The compact phone header keeps recording and settings clear of every workspace tab.
- The Export dialog now traps keyboard focus, returns focus to its Render control, closes with Escape or an outside click while idle, and blocks accidental dismissal during an active render.
- Video Editor loading, generation, recording, recovery, waveform, and progress indicators now stop continuous spin and pulse animation when the browser requests reduced motion.
- Streaming video output now settles close, cancellation, write failure, and cleanup through one terminal operation, so an abort cannot race a second file close, expose a partial file, or leave callers waiting forever.
- Creating a Video Editor project now opens it only after route navigation settles instead of leaving the new project on the workspace list.
- Filler confidence now decodes only each candidate's short source-time window instead of retaining the full clip.
- Filler-word cleanup now treats only explicit hesitation sounds such as "um" and "uh" as audio evidence. The broad CLAP "filler word" label no longer marks ordinary clean speech as high-confidence filler.
- Stock-media filters now open without a delayed outro that could keep reactive provider state alive after the browser closed.
- Recently used Video Editor workspaces now keep a strict newest-first order even when two folders are picked within the same millisecond, and switching to a known workspace moves it back to the front.
- Large project bundles now check cancellation at fixed 256 KiB hash boundaries, settle storage write failures as soon as they occur, and clean up partial imports without a late unhandled rejection.
- Preview audio gain updates now tolerate media elements leaving the page during proxy changes, and the workspace picker exposes its interactive popover as a labeled dialog.
- Lottie source-monitor playback now reacts to frame changes without a dead reactive expression that failed editor lint.
- Moving a Video Editor project to trash keeps its project folder and media recoverable until restore, permanent deletion, Empty Trash, or the 30-day cleanup.
- Video Editor effect-drop targets now use the editor selection color and only offer drag guidance when a clip can accept it.
- GPU effects now compile all blend modes in WebGL2 and keep source textures bound when creating LUTs or glyph atlases.
- 3D LUT effect now declares `highp sampler3D` precision and the shared WebGL2 effect pipeline declares `sampler2D`/`sampler3D` precision, so LUT preview and export render instead of failing with `sampler3D: No precision specified`.
- Image effects now wait for decoded pixels before replacing the source preview.
- Burned subtitles now keep their timeline track stacking order during export.
- Video Editor playback now advances the shared timeline playhead so timecode, subtitles, keyframes, nested sequences, and frame-aware effects stay on the clock frame.
- Video Editor migration keeps newer schema versions intact and repairs nested sequence durations that would otherwise clip their own content.
- Render planning now uses a store-free keyframe evaluator, so worker and server tests can calculate animated volume without loading Svelte editor state.
- Splitting a reversed clip now preserves descending source continuity across both resulting pieces.
- Splitting a clip that owns transcript or AI captions now slices both caption types alongside their source, keeping cues aligned with one-step undo.
- Newly added and removed clips now update visible timeline rows immediately instead of leaving a stale derived track index until another render.
- The clip Speed field now has an explicit accessible label, and the 320 px transport keeps primary playback, voiceover, timecode, and fullscreen controls visible without page overflow.
- Shared ONNX model downloads now retry two transient network or server failures while permanent client errors still fail at once, so RIFE, transcription, and local voice setup recover from a dropped request without hiding a bad model URL.
- Verified cleanup and unmount paths clear shuttle timers, animation frames, and Clock listeners, and that rapid direction changes and repeated presses do not create duplicate rAF loops or stacked renders.
- Grow no longer crashes when a follow finishes during a recommendation refresh.
- The mobile app now restores its workspace before loading data, keeps caches separate by workspace, and reports load failures instead of false empty states.
- Draft lists no longer crash on Android when formatting relative dates.
- The mobile workspace menu now opens as a safe-area-aware bottom sheet, and the calendar keeps its full-width grid.

### Changed

- App releases now publish an unpublished n8n package version only after the exact backend revision is live, then verify registry integrity, provenance, the n8n community-package scan, and a clean n8n install before making the GitHub release public.
- Extended `Clock` to support signed transport rates with FreeCut-accurate ceil/floor framing, precise `[start, end)` range boundaries, forward and reverse looping, pause-and-restore range semantics, one animation-frame loop across wraps, and a hard stop at timeline zero. Successive J/L presses advance `1x`/`2x`/`4x` and direction changes reset to `1x`; negative `playbackRate` never reaches `HTMLMediaElement.playbackRate`.
- Program preview now shows real reverse frame progression via the Clock frame queue and schedules short decoded reverse-audio grains through the existing track, clip, fade, and master gain paths. Media elements stay paused and are driven by drift-checked seeks; the stacked compositor and prewarm paths remain unchanged.
- Source Monitor now owns hover and focus routing, uses native positive `playbackRate` where browser audio stays safe, and falls back to exact frame-by-frame `requestAnimationFrame` seeking plus reverse-audio grains for reverse shuttle with correct `in`/`out` clamping. `K` pauses only the active monitor and leaves the other transport untouched.
- Added a compact localized shuttle indicator (`J`/`L` with direction arrow and speed) for transient shuttle mode, including the first `1x` press, with subtle styling at `1x` and highlighted styling at `2x`/`4x`. Normal play and every explicit pause reset the transport to `1x` normal mode.
- Mobile pairing now identifies the app and platform, and the approval page uses the requesting app name with device-neutral copy.
- The mobile launcher icon now gives the OpenPost mark more space.
- Grow can now focus on people who already follow you, require a minimum number of mutual connections, and sort by best match, follow-back potential, or most mutuals.
- Connected account settings now open in a compact side drawer with a fixed action bar and a collapsed developer shortcut instead of a tall modal.

### Quick Cut — multi-source, bounded streaming, and export semantics

- Quick Cut now uses stable multi-source IDs with `File`/`FileSystemFileHandle` resolution (`probeSourceFile` via `displayWidth`/`displayHeight`/`codec`/`sampleRate`/`channels`/`rotation`/`fps` and `EncodedPacketSink` keyframes) and `QuickCutSegment.sourceId`. The route opens multiple files in one picker, shows a source selector with missing-file warning, and adds segments from any source. Project JSON persists `sources` metadata and reconnects via `handles-db` with fingerprint verification before binding.
- Preview and segment editing switch to the segment's source. Timeline, timecode, and duration use the active source's metadata. Loop modes handle source switches at segment boundaries.
- Merge preflight compares real `videoCodec`/`audioCodec`/`width`/`height`/`sampleRate`/`channels`/`rotation`/`container` support via `getSupportedVideoCodecs` and FPS/timebase, estimates output bytes, and checks `navigator.storage.estimate` with a fixed reserve and explicit unknown/pending state (one storage contract). Incompatible merges require a unified transcode with a visible reason.
- Streaming is bounded: every scalable path writes to an OPFS `StreamTarget` scratch file. Export helpers return a plain `{scratchPath, fileName, scratchFile, wasLossless, reason, estimatedBytes}` token (serializable, no closure) and a production `discardScratchFile` helper (tested via `structuredClone`). Only the main thread copies chunkwise (4 MiB) via `openBlobWriter` (static imports, reader cancel/release in `finally`, partial final rollback). No `BufferTarget` or `arrayBuffer` for large outputs; temp files for merged transcode are also streaming and cleaned on success/cancel/init/encode/mux failure.
- Export semantics: no dummy `import('mediabunny')`, no speculative comments; `Conversion.isValid===false` throws `UnsupportedStreamCopyError` without retry, `AbortError`/mux failures are not retried, fallback only from explicit preflight before `output.start()`; sequence numbers monotonic per track; exact merged retains ordered segments without gaps; nearest-keyframe requires explicit before/after choice (default before with delta shown) and never includes outside content without UI warning; audio respects exact kept boundary and encoder delay; every early throw disposes `Input` and discards scratch; decoder configs handled per source or forced to one consistent encode.
- Preflight is per segment for individual exports; one non-keyframe exact segment does not force other independent segments to transcode. Merged export chooses one unified path.
- UI is exercised for multi-file picker, source switching, segment preview/loop across A/B/A, reconnect, project import/export, sequential individual and merged exports, cancellation, send-to-OpenPost, keyboard I/O/frame-step, 44 px targets and 320/390/desktop no-overflow, light/dark, with console clean.
- Local editing assistant now runs fully on device behind a WebGPU gate with a cancellable Gemma worker, streamed status, bounded history, grounded clip refs, typed and runtime-validated tool registry, one corrective retry for invalid model JSON, one bounded transcript lookup hop, explicit plan review before any mutation with destructive and review labels, sequential step results that stop on first failure, each timeline edit undoable through existing public actions, model runtime registration and unload, model cache visibility and quota-aware first-load preflight that blocks when insufficient, and no fake persistence. Tools cover find clips, search transcript, select, seek, add title, split, ripple delete, set speed, set volume, trim, add transition, open silence review and open filler review with scoped targets. The left rail adds an Assistant versus Generate switcher above voice and music with short direct copy, keyboard tabs, visible focus, 44px touch targets, 320px and 390px fit and dark theme support. Wired through the video editor route with project-scoped state and autosave. Includes pure tests for invalid JSON correction, stale refs, confirmation before mutation, cancellation, sequential results and scoped handoff, and browser tests for plan review, mobile overflow and keyboard behavior.
- Video Editor browser storage for presets, diagnostics, voiceover preferences, local AI models, processing scratch files, exports, and recorder recovery now has an exact privacy-inventory entry with its purpose and retention. Non-cache local AI backends no longer carry fake Cache Storage names.
- Marketing type checks now follow only the shared frontend modules the site imports instead of treating the full Video Editor source and test tree as marketing code.
- The public homepage now identifies solo founders as its audience in the server-rendered hero before JavaScript runs.
- Public marketing and connector-guide pages now state their intended audience before hydration, and the reviewed no-JavaScript evidence matches the visible production copy.
- Source monitoring, timeline marker editing, and composition authoring now use the shared input, slider, checkbox, and select controls while keeping frame-accurate keyboard edits, grouped blend modes, compact editor sizing, and narrow-screen fit.
- All 21 WebGPU transitions now compile and render through a real Chromium GPU adapter in browser tests, with read-back pixel proof for outgoing, midpoint, incoming, and advertised direction behavior. Sparkles, Chromatic, Liquid Distort, and Light Leak Burn now preserve exact endpoint frames.
- Motion, shape, Lottie, color, effect, expression, and published-control panels now use shared editor controls. Repeated keyboard slider input previews every step but commits one undo entry when the key gesture ends.
- Quick Cut, recording, transcription, local AI, scene, project, keyframe, shortcut, and timeline tools now use the same accessible form controls as the rest of OpenPost. Select menus keep their labels and disabled states, checked recording sources retain their visible selection, and the editor has no remaining native form-control exceptions.

### Tests

- Added deterministic Clock tests for negative-rate ceil semantics, range start/end boundaries, single-loop scheduling, zero clamping, successive J/L speeds and direction changes, and throttled `timeupdate`; exact reverse-audio sample, rate, envelope, cleanup, and boundary tests; shortcut and ownership tests; and Chromium coverage for the localized shuttle indicator and its 320px fit.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Add public About, Contact, and Developers pages, linked product and operator structured data, an Atom changelog feed, direct agent interface guidance, and explicit search and model-training permission for public marketing content.

### Changed

- Add server, support, terms, license, and usage metadata to the generated OpenAPI contract.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- PostgreSQL upgrades now remove the retired Video Editor tables in foreign-key order instead of failing during startup.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- Rate stretch now scales keyframe timing and ripples linked downstream clips on each synchronized track.
- Crossfades now span both sides of the cut and render both clips in preview and export using validated hidden source handles.
- Made the standalone Expo app the only Android app. GitHub releases now publish its signed `openpost-app-android.apk`; the old web wrapper and its server chooser are gone.
- Reorganized Settings into clear Personal, Workspace, Organization, and Instance groups with compact desktop tabs and one mobile selector.
- Rewrote settings labels and help text so controls describe their scope and effect consistently.
- Kept save actions in the page flow instead of moving them over page content.
- Documented optional account features as per connected account in Accounts, Analytics, Engagement and Inbox, and provider docs. Direct messages, Comments and replies, Analytics, and Grow start off for new accounts. Users choose them after connection or in Account details. Disabling a feature stops future provider reads and writes without deleting history or revoking provider authorization. Provider support, required scopes, and plan access remain distinct. Grow never follows automatically.
- Updated the platform overview to clarify that Grow is available only for Bluesky and Mastodon, Direct messages for X, Bluesky, Facebook Pages, Instagram Professional accounts, and Mastodon, Engagement comments and replies for X, Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn, Threads, Facebook Pages, Instagram, and YouTube, and Analytics for X, Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Discord webhooks support none of these optional features.
- Clarified per-provider support notes for Bluesky, Mastodon, X, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads, YouTube, TikTok, and Discord so provider docs list only implemented optional features and their required scopes, and note that each feature starts off and is controlled per account.
- Added upgrade notes to Accounts and Upgrades explaining that existing accounts keep current behavior: previous Inbox opt-ins become Direct messages choices, current Analytics and Engagement behavior remains enabled, Grow is enabled only where stored Grow sync state exists, and other accounts receive explicit off choices so routine reauthorization does not retrigger the setup prompt.

### Fixed

- Directly trimming a transitioned clip edge now previews the break, removes the transition with a toast, and restores it with the same undo step.
- Timeline selections no longer retain clips removed by an edit or undo state change.
- Ripple trims now preview and apply the same inserted or removed time across unlocked sync-locked tracks while preserving split media source ranges.
- Video Editor drag, undo, save, and export flows now snapshot reactive timeline state without browser cloning failures.
- Improved the Android app's large-text layout, screen-reader labels, workspace selection, draft menu, attachment retries, destination removal errors, post rescheduling, and delete failure handling.
- Load only the active settings page so hidden pages no longer fetch data or update in the background.
- Keep Settings usable without horizontal overflow at narrow mobile widths.
- Treat the absence of a pending Organization ownership transfer as a normal empty state instead of a browser error.
- Keep provider retry and reconnect actions visible instead of grouping them with providers that need administrator setup.

### Removed

- The entire cloud-synced OpenPost Video Editor: frontend editor (~23k lines), `/video-editor/*` sync API, `videoproject` package, `VideoProject*`/`VideoReturnToken` models, bundled editor model packs and audio assets, and the `@openpost/video-project` package. Migration 107 drops `video_projects`, `video_project_assets`, `video_project_revisions`, `video_return_tokens`, and `media_attachments.video_project_id`.
- Composer return-token handoff. "Edit video" now links to `/video-editor` via plain URL parameters.
- Removed the unused settings search, duplicate media-retention information, and the duplicate Organization deletion control from Workspace settings.

### Added

- Video Editor effects can now be dragged onto one visual clip or a compatible multi-selection, with live drop previews and one undo step.
- The Video Editor timeline now supports drag-marquee selection across tracks, with additive selection modifiers and a visible selection box.
- OpenPost Video Editor now supports ripple trim, rate stretch from either edge, linked-selection controls and shortcuts, multi-clip link and unlink actions, group moves and deletes, visible transition spans, and explicit transition removal.
- Video Editor move, trim, slip, and slide tools now keep synchronized audio and video companions aligned across every affected track.
- Timeline edits now preserve valid transition handles and keyframes instead of leaving broken cuts or moving keys into blend-owned frames.
- **OpenPost Video Editor** (`/video-editor`, Chromium-only): workspace folder on your disk is the source of truth (projects, media, caches, exports as plain files). The editor includes a layered multi-track preview, undo/redo, text and subtitle editing, broad clip keyframes with cubic and spring easing, a WebGL2 effects and color stack, cached waveforms and filmstrips, proxies, scene and silence tools, and transcript word editing. Rendered export supports MP4, MOV, WebM, MKV, MP3, AAC, and WAV with codec, size, quality, range, subtitle, progress, and cancel controls. Send to OpenPost uploads the finished export to the media library.
- Preview controls now match FreeCut's device-only monitor gain and mute, fit and fixed zoom presets, native fullscreen, audio-only playback, and full-resolution frame capture. Captured frames download and also join the project's media pool.
- Timeline editing now exposes ordered video and audio track creation, safe track removal, sticky lock/visibility/mute/solo/sync-lock controls, adaptive snapping, trim-start and trim-end handles, rolling cuts, source slip, neighbor-aware slide, and source-bound rate stretch. Pointer work is frame-accurate, cancelable, and grouped into one undo step; the same tools support one-frame and ten-frame keyboard edits.
- **Quick Cut** (`/quick-cut`): fast lossless trimming - mark I/O segments, save each without re-encoding via stream-copy. Inspired by LosslessCut's segment flow (behavioral reference only).
- **Recorder** (`/record`): screen, camera, microphone, and screen+camera PiP-composited capture saved locally.
- Stock-media client re-homed from the deleted editor to `$lib/stock-media`.
- Added Grow usage guide at `/usage/grow` describing discovery and follow as an optional feature per connected Bluesky and Mastodon account. It starts off, uses an explicit per-account choice, never follows automatically, and shows how enabling queues discovery while disabling stops future provider calls without deleting history or revoking provider authorization.

## [3.14.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Added `changes/*.md` fragment workflow that merges per-issue changelog entries into `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` before each release, grouped by heading; fragments are deleted after merge so the manual changelog stays conflict-free across parallel tickets.
- Added `devenv` `doctor` script that proxies to `bun run doctor` for a single local health gate.

### Changed

- Made the product clear at a glance in README and marketing with refreshed hero, product screenshots, and copy that shows the Publication and Rendition workspace without hiding provider truth.
- Documented the single backend runtime location for `OPENPOST_PADDLE_*` (`backend/.env` for devenv, container environment for Docker) and clarified that bare `PADDLE_*` is never read; Cloud mode now warns at startup with the exact ignored names without printing values.
- Refreshed product screenshots as trustworthy, exact renders of the current app and documented the fragment workflow with granular check guidance (`check:frontend:types`, `check:contracts`, `test:file`, `test:backend:pkg`) and an `.rgignore` to keep searches fast.
- Staged provider, security, and scheduling flows with progressive disclosure: available providers stay primary while setup-required providers move behind a collapsed section, failed provider errors stay dominant with a retry beside the message, authenticator setup is staged one primary action at a time, quick schedule paths are primary while calendar and randomization are behind disclosure, and Workspace Preferences and Security panels collapse media lifecycle, danger zone, and identity sections.

### Fixed

- Instance admin plan overrides now work end to end. Assigning an override previously failed with a 500 because the generated subscription row carried an empty `workspace_id` that violated the Postgres foreign key; the model now stores a NULL workspace, and the override grants plan entitlements exactly like a paid Paddle subscription across billing status, entitlement checks, setup state, and public profiles.
- Removing an override from the plan dialog previously returned 422 because the empty `plan_id` was rejected by request validation; empty `plan_id` now reaches the removal path as documented.
- Resolved configured Mastodon adapter by canonical `instance_url` before dynamic registration so OAuth callbacks find the correct provider key.
- Loaded `SSL_CERT_FILE` into the Go root pool on macOS so local E2E Mastodon CA is trusted without `InsecureSkipVerify`.
- Ignored aborted fetch errors after component teardown and pagehide so stale composer requests do not pollute console telemetry.
- Rendered self-hosted registration and onboarding copy and skipped the hosted purchase-choice gate when `purchase_choice_required` is false; preserved signup, verify, and redirect context in purchase-choice Change links and showed a locked checkout state when a purchase choice is bound.
- Handled first-load Vite dev race for generated SvelteKit nodes with graceful chunk-reload (`vite:preloadError` plus `error` and `unhandledrejection`) guarded by a sessionStorage retry budget and proactive service-worker `controllerchange` handling, and cleared the budget after a successful load.
- Fixed Bun SQLite tag warning by using `column:type` and `column:notnull` so type and not-null are not parsed as standalone options.
- Made register and verify-email config loading resilient with `Promise.allSettled` and `try/finally`, always clearing loading state and showing a Retry action while preserving form values; corrected verification copy to inbox, code, address, and retry guidance.
- Deduplicated desktop setup guides so the home guide is visible on desktop and hidden on mobile while the composer guide does the opposite, and mapped raw backend OAuth errors for Mastodon `instance_url` and X callback allowlists to user-facing connection messages.
- Reconciled server-assigned Segment and Rendition IDs after draft creation so subsequent edits do not hit the unique position constraint, and closed the account menu before Settings navigation so it does not cover the destination page.
- Kept the writing surface focused by removing the inline schedule helper from the text post composer.

## [3.13.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Instance administrators can assign or remove plan overrides for users without requiring Paddle checkout, through a new admin endpoint and plan selection dialog.

### Fixed

- Extended button and card touch targets with an invisible bottom area to improve mobile tap usability.
- Removed unnecessary wrapper padding around the Workspace setup guide in the composer.
- Fixed whitespace rendering in feedback dialog radio items.

## [3.12.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Retired the Post authoring model end to end. Post HTTP routes, MCP post and draft tools, the legacy `publish_post` Job kind, and the `posts` service are removed; the publisher, composer, scheduler, calendar, Engagement, Messaging, and notification paths operate only on Publication and Rendition identifiers. Historical migration files still upgrade older databases, and immutable `legacy_post` / `legacy_post_variant` aliases resolve old links to canonical Publications. The Post compatibility tables (`posts`, `post_destinations`, `post_media`, `post_variants`, `thread_drafts`, `post_media_deliveries`) are dropped after the legacy backfill completes and no Post rows or pending `publish_post` Jobs remain.

- Added repository-owned Oxlint checks that reject unsafe type widening, unverified runtime boundaries, reflective access, module mocking, and other patterns that weaken type and dependency contracts.
- Split engagement and messaging refresh, persistence, provider seams, recurring Jobs, and retries into independent capability outcomes, and removed the transitional communications runtime.
- Contracted REST, MCP, CLI, browser, and direct application Workspace authorization onto one read, edit, or administer decision, removed middleware-owned and membership-only policy helpers, and kept durable Jobs explicitly scoped without user impersonation.
- Extracted Messaging into an independent application module with internal Workspace authorization, capability-specific provider access, stored conversation reads and mutations, durable sends, typed outcomes, provider-write fencing, and its own recurring collection chain over transitional sync-state storage.
- Extracted Engagement into a transport-independent application module with internal Workspace authorization, a capability-specific provider port, stored read and archive state, typed outcomes, provider-write fencing, and its own recurring Job chain and health state.
- Completed Publication-only composer recovery: media queues now belong to the Composer session module, editor returns are bound once to the original Workspace, Publication, and revision, Workspace changes preserve save, discard, or stay, and old Post links redirect to canonical Publication URLs without mounting a Post-backed composer.
- Publishing, Workspace invitation, and Organization ownership producers now emit typed notification outcomes. Workspace team owns invitation delivery generations and lifecycle updates, while notifications retain only redacted, deduplicated provider delivery evidence.
- Removed the raw notification producer API, sealed topic and delivery policy behind typed outcomes, and split notification email delivery from password reset, verification, and identity email capabilities across SMTP, Resend, and Cloudflare adapters.
- The text-and-thread composer now uses one Publication-backed browser session for new and existing drafts. The session owns serialized revision saves, conflicts, validation, scheduling, immediate publishing, retries, cancellation, deletion, and success reset through the typed Publication client.
- Notification producers can now record sealed domain outcomes whose topic, delivery, Mute, deduplication, action, and presentation policy comes from one backend catalogue. Notification settings use the catalogue's generated API projection while keeping exhaustive English and Portuguese labels, descriptions, and icons in the frontend.
- Moved media usage and lifecycle protection, account and Workspace deletion, background Job scoping, and activity navigation onto canonical Publication, Segment, and Rendition ownership instead of legacy Post authoring state.
- Deprecated retained Post HTTP compatibility routes, recorded their Publication replacements and sunset evidence in the compatibility registry, added OpenAPI migration guidance, and documented the minimum 90-day and two-later-stable-release removal gate.
- Added canonical Publication aliases and terminal legacy delivery evidence to the historical Post migration so published and failed compatibility rows resolve safely without provider calls.
- Moved planner calendar loading and CLI post/thread workflows onto canonical Publication list, creation, update, schedule, and deletion contracts, with Publication calendar filters available to MCP.
- Completed the canonical Publication delivery path with application-owned get, list, history, delete, cancellation, validation, scheduling, publishing, and retry operations; stable transport-neutral error categories; a canonical cancellation contract for REST and MCP; and persisted effective random-delay ranges whose exact Job times are covered by Publication authorization.
- Unified Workspace access behind one application decision for read, edit, and administer actions across request middleware and transactional callers. The decision now combines credential Workspace binding, Organization identity policy, active Workspace membership, and role level while keeping safe denial separate from operational failure.
- Proved the complete UX program through one combined browser and integration matrix covering the first-use journey, daily work, collaboration and safety, local recovery, responsive presentations, themes, locales, keyboard and announced state, automated serious and critical accessibility checks, clean console output, and synchronized Self-hosted claims. Reconciled the audit-remediation backlog to remove the completed UX work and retain external status infrastructure as a separate deferred boundary.
- Split Cloudflare edge changes into a read-only preparation and a separate apply that requires the reviewed forward-plan and prepared-operation digests, so operators can inspect the live snapshot and exact rollback before any production write.
- Grouped the former marketing and documentation redirect rules into one Cloudflare zone, so each phase is inspected, applied, and rolled back once without one host overwriting the other.
- Kept the exact Markdown `Accept` gate within the function set Cloudflare permits in every deployed edge phase, so the reviewed plan can be applied without weakening rejection of mixed, weighted, wildcard, parameterized, repeated, or internally spaced values.
- Added a bounded four-hour Cloudflare edge TTL to the exact `Accept` cache variants so repeated HTML and Markdown requests produce real cache hits while remaining separated in both request orders.
- Published a dedicated Self-hosted product path with an explicit no-software-fee boundary outside Hosted service plans, complete operator responsibilities, current deployment and source links, responsive no-JavaScript HTML, and an agent-readable Markdown representation.
- Completed local application-state recovery with distinct offline, forbidden, not-found, rejected-request, and server-error guidance; in-place connection recovery; focused and announced error states; and destructive confirmations that retain only unfinished targets and remain open when an operation does not complete. Media and provider-configuration deletion are idempotent so a retry can safely reconcile a response lost after commit.
- Proved the collaboration-and-safety cohort across truthful invitation recovery, atomic Workspace and Organization deletion, accepted ownership transfer, permission-safe audit exports, and responsive, localized Daily email and temporary Mute controls.
- Shared one local Turbo task cache across OpenPost worktrees with a 2 GiB total cap, removed immutable editor models and audio from frontend cache archives and build-tool copy inputs, validated their declared inventory before linking them across generated web, Go embed, and Android trees, and omitted them from CI checkouts that do not build the application. CI keeps exact-run frontend caches ephemeral so source-map uploads still execute.
- Organization Owners can now select and permanently delete any owned Organization without Workspace access after a complete preview, exact-name confirmation, and recent authentication; unconfirmed Paddle subscriptions, outstanding checkouts, pending ownership transfer, provider-scheduled work, other provider work, and cleanup remain explicit blockers, canceled checkouts cannot resume and retain an opaque boundary that terminates late Paddle subscriptions, failure is atomic, affected access, credentials, current and evidenced historical invitation email Jobs, ownership-expiry or notification Jobs end on success, and only content-free lifecycle and required billing evidence remains.
- Updated `golang.org/x/image` to 0.45.0 to fix excessive memory allocation while validating VP8L images.
- Added temporary account-wide and Workspace notification Mutes on both Notifications and Settings, with visible absolute end times and an idempotent end-now action. Mutes pause optional Immediate and Daily email without changing saved preferences, conservatively suppress pre-upgrade queued optional mail whose Workspace scope is unknown, resolve the Workspace scope first when scopes overlap, expire automatically, keep in-app notifications immediate, and never suppress Transactional security, access, invitation, or critical billing email. Workspace-bound credentials receive only their Workspace Mutes when they reconcile state. Database upgrades apply migration 100 automatically.
- Organization Owners can now select an Organization without Workspace access, see its current Owner, and nominate an active member after recent authentication and exact confirmation; a nominee can resolve the standalone action without Workspace access. Every ownership read and action enforces the Organization identity and SSO assurance decision without requiring Workspace access, and the transport-independent initiation service requires an unscoped browser credential and consumes one recent-authentication grant. The durable, expiring Transactional action uses semantic English and Portuguese notification content, clears and suppresses actions whenever transfer state cannot be loaded or its URL changes, preserves the current Owner through decline, expiry, or revocation, records every reached initiation failure in domain-owned audit evidence, exposes ownership transfers in the Organization audit filter, and atomically moves creator and subscription authority plus the Owner role to the accepting nominee while demoting the prior Owner to Administrator. Database upgrades apply migration 097 automatically; no operator action is required.
- Optional notification email topics now support Off, Immediate, or Daily delivery with a saved local time and IANA timezone. Daily items are durably batched and deduplicated per user and window, use bounded Job retries and one idempotency key, and advance only after a confirmed send; Transactional security, access, invitation, and critical billing email remains immediate.
- Fixed Cloudflare edge cache variance so parameterized and weighted Markdown requests cannot reuse the exact Markdown representation, and kept HTML fallbacks from being mislabeled when a Markdown artifact is unavailable.
- Permanent Workspace deletion now shows exact removal, retention, recovery, and lifecycle-blocker facts; requires the Organization Owner, the canonical Workspace name, and recent authentication; rechecks blockers atomically; preserves dialog and data state on failure; and retains Organization-scoped audit evidence after success.
- Added a read-only deployment proof for the public Markdown surfaces that binds the clean reviewed Git revision to both Cloudflare Pages builds by full commit hash, exact local and live artifacts, discovery and native-interface behavior, and a separate 24-hour AI crawl observation. The documentation full corpus now links only to explicit generated Markdown or intentional native machine assets.
- Instance administrators can now page, filter, and export the same permission-safe audit vocabulary across every Organization, while Organization Owner boundaries remain unchanged and ordinary users, Workspace roles, scoped tokens, and other non-browser credentials cannot request instance-wide evidence.
- Workspace invitations now distinguish provider-accepted Sent email from webhook-confirmed Delivered email, retain redacted and idempotent callback evidence, ignore stale or terminal-generation callbacks, show accepted and revoked records to administrators, return one safe acceptance error, and protect resends with a one-minute atomic cooldown plus the existing five-per-hour limit. Database upgrades apply migration 096 automatically; operators may configure `OPENPOST_EMAIL_DELIVERY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` when their mail provider supports delivery callbacks.
- Added a deterministic Cloudflare plan for both public hosts. It uses the route catalogues to redirect known paths and select Markdown only for exact requests, checks Free-plan limits before changes, inspects conflicts without writing, records apply evidence, and generates a reviewable rollback.
- Workspace invitations now queue one branded, expiring Transactional email for registered and unregistered recipients, bypass optional notification preferences, keep secrets out of ordinary notification and audit records, and preserve a truthful copy-link fallback when delivery is unavailable or fails. Database upgrades apply migration 094 automatically to add delivery state to existing invitations; no operator action is required.
- Organization Owners can now page, filter, and export one permission-safe audit projection over identity, Workspace access, Organization-scoped impersonation, billing checkout, MCP, Publication lifecycle and authorization, and provider-write evidence without gaining Workspace content access or exposing emails, content, secrets, tokens, invitation links, credentials, or raw provider responses. Owners who are not Workspace members can use the audit UI, and Android exports use authenticated requests.
- Proved the complete daily-workflow cohort across paged Engagement and Messages history, request races and retries, all eight exact Rendition outcomes, and responsive, localized Accounts and Paddle billing journeys.
- Marketing and documentation builds now prove one complete public delivery contract across every eligible HTML and Markdown route, including prerendered meaning, discovery, safety, deterministic output, cache planning, size limits, and explicit artifact content types.
- Composer destination controls now retain a usable mobile scroll area when first-use guidance is present.
- Split the billing page into Paddle-backed subscription facts, OpenPost usage, and Paddle-managed payment tasks; added verified billing-contact display, purpose-specific payment and cancellation links with a fresh generic portal fallback, qualified list-price estimates, and kept payment methods and invoice documents managed in Paddle.
- Documentation builds now expand controlled includes, normalize supported VitePress and raw HTML, publish useful no-JavaScript API guidance, and generate a bounded, provenance-preserving `llms-full.txt` convenience corpus from reviewed catalogue policy.
- Updated CI and release images to Go 1.26.6 for the latest standard-library security fixes, provisioned Nix before repository policy checks, and made partial browser-job reruns reuse the newest canonical build artifact.
- Direct and Settings-embedded social account management now share one explicitly configured Workspace component, while each route keeps its own authentication, OAuth continuation, URL cleanup, and one-time feedback without redirect flashes.
- Moved the canonical source, release links, installation commands, support URLs, badges, and container image namespace to the `getopenpost` GitHub organization while retaining the published MCP Registry identifier for compatibility.
- Messages now loads older conversation history near the top with stable cursor pages, an accessible manual control, exact reading-position preservation, deduplication, and stale-request protection across new messages, conversations, and Workspaces.
- Messages now reaches complete conversation history with stable cursor pages, deduplicated appends that keep newer records, preserved filters and selection, and in-place first-page and older-page retries.
- Publication details now keep each Rendition's exact queued, submitted, processing, provider-scheduled, live, rejected, ambiguous, or manual-resolution outcome, show safe normalized failure and attempt evidence, and offer retry only when the canonical provider-write result proves another send is safe.
- Activity, Publication detail, and lifecycle history now share exact destination outcomes and safe recovery controls, while the timeline separates event occurrence from provider attempts, reconciliation, and the latest effective state so older failures cannot appear current.
- Composer schedule and submit results now keep every destination's exact outcome visible, link to Publication detail, and offer only the canonical safe retry or review action.
- Every public browser-tool page now keeps purpose, audience, inputs, outputs, limits, privacy behavior, and a next step in no-JavaScript HTML and focused build-generated Markdown.
- Every ordinary public documentation page now publishes deterministic Markdown with canonical absolute links, per-page HTML discovery, an HTML-only sitemap, and a structured documentation `llms.txt` derived from the checked-in documentation catalogue.
- Engagement now reaches complete saved history with stable cursor pages, in-place retries, deduplicated appends, and a searchable, paged Publication filter that keeps older selections.
- Every platform and comparison page now publishes a build-generated Markdown representation with canonical metadata, provider limits or comparison evidence, HTML alternate discovery, and optional `llms.txt` sections derived from the marketing route manifest.
- Marketing and documentation production builds now generate deterministic homepage Markdown and `llms.txt` discovery files from canonical public sources, advertise them from canonical HTML, and keep sitemaps HTML-only.
- Proved the complete first-use cohort from verified signup through Workspace Activation with deterministic email, Paddle, and destination adapters, recovery and role coverage, responsive and presentation checks, and clean browser-console assertions.
- Every static marketing page now has a deterministic Markdown representation, with route metadata owning page identity and discovery policy, curated optional and primary `llms.txt` links, unlisted legal and changelog files, semantic conversion checks, and a per-page size ceiling.
- Replaced the frontend formatting and general JavaScript lint passes with Oxfmt and Oxlint, retained ESLint for Svelte template rules, upgraded production builds to Vite 8 and Rolldown, cached independent frontend quality tasks with Turbo, parallelized safe repository checks and tests, and reused the shared Go cache for local backend builds.
- Replaced the overlapping package, Devenv, CI, hook, and release command graphs with one root task registry for formatting, linting, checks, tests, builds, verification, and release subcommands; added consistent surface scopes and policy selectors; removed obsolete aliases; and made CI and local release checks call the same tasks.
- Updated the transitive Nano ID security pin so the exhaustive release dependency audit passes without the high-severity zero-size custom-generator advisory.
- Made the documentation preview accept caller-selected host and port arguments so its isolated browser gate starts reliably.
- Completed the privacy-limited first-use PostHog journey from signup intent through Workspace Activation, with server-owned lifecycle outcomes, strict browser and backend event allowlists, contract and integration coverage, and an MCP-managed production funnel with personless smoke verification.
- The first successful Publication schedule or submission now records one server-owned Workspace Activation under retries and concurrency, emits one authoritative analytics event, retires setup guidance, and offers immediate View publication and Create another actions.
- Workspace setup now recognizes the first meaningful text, media attachment, or thread-mode choice once per Workspace, while focus, destination selection, empty drafts, and repeated composer instances do not count. Its browser event allows only the interaction category and excludes authored content, media, identity, destination, and secret URL data.
- Successful first-destination OAuth now opens a fresh composer with the new Workspace destination selected, while cancellation and failure return to actionable account management without exposing provider secrets in return parameters.
- Added a server-derived Workspace setup guide that resumes from subscription, destination, and Publication state on the home, Accounts, and composer surfaces without a separate onboarding step index. Organization Owners receive the complete applicable journey, Organization administrators receive authorized billing guidance, Workspace administrators and editors receive only authorized content actions, viewers receive no setup actions, and self-hosted deployments omit Hosted service billing steps.
- Shift-activating draft deletion now bypasses the confirmation dialog consistently in the composer, planner, and day-post drawers.
- Reduced the ordinary local release gate to generated and type checks, lint, and unit tests; production builds, race and security checks, browser suites, and Docker image proof remain available through the explicit full rehearsal and candidate CI.
- Added one changed-file check for whitespace, conflict markers, formatting and Svelte parsing, Go formatting, shell syntax, and Nix syntax, and installed the same implementation as the pre-commit and pushed-range pre-push hooks.

### Fixed

- Trimmed the SMTP username so a trailing space in `OPENPOST_SMTP_USERNAME` cannot send a malformed AUTH identity and fail notification email delivery with an SMTP authentication error.
- Logged the terminal failure message when a background Job fails and recorded its retryability in error telemetry, so transient delivery failures are diagnosable without inspecting the database.
- Kept homepage animation cleanup inside the browser lifecycle so marketing prerender no longer calls browser-only animation APIs.
- Kept unlimited Publication scheduling operational when quota storage is unavailable, while preserving canonical usage accounting whenever counters exist and keeping limited plans fail-closed.
- Stopped routine autosaves from replaying the Saved animation and from replacing an unchanged Image Editor document, which refreshed page previews after edits.
- Accepted equivalent absolute and origin-relative canonical redirect locations in the public deployment proof while continuing to require the exact destination and preserved query.
- Kept the generated public Nix module example on `ghcr.io/getopenpost/openpost:latest` even when the linked deployment source pins a verified release digest.
- Restored marketing and documentation page views by requiring their production PostHog build settings, routed hosted browser telemetry through the managed first-party proxy, added matching page-leave events and privacy-limited Core Web Vitals, and kept route templates in SDK-owned URL properties.
- "Create another" after first Activation now opens a clean composer instead of retaining the published text and draft identity.
- Made direct documentation builds restore their ignored OpenAPI inputs from the tracked canonical spec before VitePress starts, so clean deployment checkouts cannot depend on generated local files.

## [3.11.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Added one canonical hosted-plan catalogue and an expiring signed purchase choice that keeps exact pricing and trial terms through password signup, email verification, refresh, and identity-provider signup without defaulting invalid selections to Founder.
- Added an explicit first-Workspace confirmation that shows the selected plan and trial terms, atomically binds the named Workspace to one checkout attempt, and resumes that attempt after refresh without creating duplicates.

### Fixed

- Kept thread remove controls above their textareas, tightened publication-history and meme-picker overlays to their content, highlighted the active sidebar draft, removed the redundant AI alt-text review note, and retried one safe transient Memegen catalog read.
- Restored release gating after the hosted purchase-flow merge by accepting formatter-safe provider-catalog sources and checking marketing links and trial copy against the canonical purchase terms.

## [3.10.1] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Qualified PostgreSQL provider-delivery upserts so the durable write fence reaches the provider instead of failing before every publication request.

### Changed

- Pruned completed and currently out-of-scope audit-remediation entries so the backlog contains only active or explicitly deferred work.

## [3.10.0] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- Added a repository map, an agent workflow router, and a read-only doctor for local workflow artifacts and configured GitHub triage labels.

### Fixed

- Updated the marketing browser contract to verify the fictional workflow disclosure after removal of the unproved customer-logo rail.
- Made the changed-file pre-push formatter load the Svelte parser explicitly so marketing component changes are checked instead of blocking every push.
- Removed unproved customer-logo usage claims, labeled generated personas and workflows as fictional examples, and added a dated register that validates proof-claim owners, evidence, review dates, and expiry.
- Kept failed conversation read-state writes visible and retryable instead of clearing unread state locally, and made Android releases fail closed rather than publishing an unsigned APK under the installable asset name.
- Bound hosted checkout completion to its opaque billing attempt, persisted a validated same-origin return path with the selected plan and period, and made that path one-time so unrelated subscriptions, refreshes, and replay cannot redirect a user.
- Moved analytics account filtering, ordering, exact totals, and cursor paging to the stored-data API so workspaces with more than 50 post results keep complete newest/history views and account summaries.
- Made remote destination pickers page through provider options, deduplicate appended results, bind requests to current setting context, and clear incompatible child selections when a parent changes.
- Scrubbed engagement author and attachment metadata when a provider reports deletion or a provider-side delete succeeds, instead of retaining those fields after the body was removed.
- Bound account capability caches to the full settings and target context, output profile, intent, media shape, locale, and region so one community, location, or policy mode cannot reuse another target's provider rules.
- Extended the shared capability contract with hard and recommended title, body, description, alt-text, dimension, codec, frame-rate, audio, and local-time rules; provider catalogues and cross-transport parity coverage can now adopt those constraints incrementally.
- Added the schema and API foundation for provider subdestination targets, including target-aware authorization, retry, delete, uniqueness, and legacy Mastodon backfill behavior; provider-setting binding remains a follow-up gate before subtargets are advertised.
- Added a canonical provider-delivery projection with queued, submitted, processing, provider-scheduled, live, rejected, ambiguous, and manual-resolution states, exact reconciliation timing, and a stale-attempt fence, and exposed it on publication destinations.
- Removed the redundant gap between the desktop sidebar's draft list and workspace-navigation divider.

## [3.9.6] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Escaped LinkedIn's reserved commentary characters at the provider boundary so ordinary post text with parentheses or other markup symbols is published in full instead of rendering only the prefix.

## [3.9.5] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Aligned the hosted production privacy-policy version with the current application contract so candidate configuration validation and PostHog-enabled deployment use the same managed runtime environment.

## [3.9.4] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- Made GitHub candidate CI the release correctness authority, planned pull-request checks from the fail-closed release-surface registry, split independent lint and browser work, reused SHA-addressed web artifacts in Playwright and the production image, enabled GitHub-backed Turbo caches, moved the frontend cache proof off the ordinary critical path, reduced pre-push checks to changed-file formatting, and moved Android compilation into candidate CI so tag releases only verify and sign the retained APK.

### Fixed

- Remove the legacy Umami loader from the documentation build now that the shared PostHog telemetry client owns that surface.
- Bound each GitHub release asset upload so a stalled transfer is terminated and retried instead of blocking image promotion and production deployment indefinitely.

## [3.9.3] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Invoked the draft-asset upload helper through Bash and recorded its executable mode so release runners cannot reject it before its bounded retries run.

## [3.9.2] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Retry draft-release discovery and asset uploads so GitHub's eventual consistency cannot cancel a release matrix immediately after the draft is created.

## [3.9.1] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Resolved release artifacts from the attempt that produced each successful artifact, so a partial CI rerun can reuse the tested image manifest while consuming newly rebuilt frontend assets.

## [3.9.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Added one privacy-limited PostHog telemetry layer across the app, backend, marketing site, and documentation, with explicit browser intent events, authoritative server outcomes, background-job and request error capture, opaque identity, runtime self-host configuration, and release-linked source maps.

### Changed

- Replaced the public Umami tracker with cookieless, memory-only PostHog analytics; disabled autocapture, session replay, console and network-body capture, advertising profiles, and cross-site identity; and updated the hosted Privacy Policy and subprocessor register for the managed telemetry boundary.

### Fixed

- Prevented repeated desktop or mobile New post actions from orphaning the replacement composer's account-loading state, so the Social Set and platform controls no longer disappear behind a permanent loading indicator.
- Preserved PostHog exception structure while adding application context, removed sensitive absolute URLs from browser stacks without dropping static source-map locations, propagated browser correlation through raw media transports, and added the marketing SvelteKit error boundary.
- Normalized publication authorization times to database precision so immediate publishes cannot fail before reaching a provider, and surfaced terminal preflight failures as failed instead of leaving them scheduled and pending.
- Scoped the Posts page totals and pagination to the selected Scheduled, Published, Failed, or Drafts tab instead of showing whole-history counts beside a filtered tab.
- Removed the three-item cap from the desktop draft planner, made long draft lists scroll, grouped Editors, Accounts, and Settings consistently, and added a compact animated collapse control for the lower workspace navigation.
- Kept replies authored by a connected social account out of its own Engagement feed and hid self-authored rows collected by earlier versions.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Added an optional Memegen-backed meme maker to the shared media picker with cached template search, editable captions and image slots, validated AI suggestions, bounded previews, Media-library imports, source metadata, and durable generation recipes.

### Changed

- Split Profile, Security, Developer, Billing, Schedule, Brand, Instance, and workspace preferences into tab-owned Settings modules that each keep loading, mutation, dirty-state, and rendering behavior local while the route owns only navigation and composition.
- Added an executable release lifecycle that shares Conventional Commit and workflow-run decisions with local preparation and verifies the identity-preserving complete-draft-to-published transition in hosted delivery.
- Made one Publication application boundary own access checks, creation, updates, validation, scheduling, immediate publishing, and retry orchestration across REST, MCP, CLI, and retained Post compatibility adapters.
- Centralized all durable job kinds, construction defaults, execution dispatch, retry classification, recurrence, stale-worker recovery, and ambiguous provider-write fencing in the job registry so producers, migrations, and workers share one policy.
- Added repository-owned engineering workflow skills and documented the GitHub issue tracker, triage labels, and single-context domain-document conventions used by agents.

### Fixed

- Kept disconnected historical account rows out of workspace provider-readiness decisions so an active verified X or Mastodon connection is not marked for reconnection by an older inactive destination.
- Kept AI meme suggestion previews recoverable when hosted rendering is slow or interrupted, retried one safe transient image download, and stopped canceled requests from appearing as expired sessions.

## [3.7.3] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Kept configured cloud providers and active migrated accounts usable while certification evidence is being populated, without making uncertified providers publicly claimable. Migration 085 validates only linked, active, non-revoked legacy grants with stored encrypted access credentials. Cloud operators can opt into strict operational evidence enforcement with `OPENPOST_PROVIDER_CERTIFICATION_ENFORCED=true` after the required runtime controls, approvals, tests, and scope evidence exist.

## [3.7.2] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Allowed the image-promotion job to read the private draft release with its GitHub token before verifying the complete asset set.

## [3.7.1] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Made the release workflow retrieve draft releases by their database ID because GitHub's tag endpoint does not return drafts, allowing failed tag workflows to fix forward without retagging.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Added account settings for verification-code email changes, linked sign-in identity details with last-credential safeguards, finite scoped API-token creation, per-field public-profile visibility, and browser-scoped personal preferences. Migration 081 adds email-change challenges, linked-identity display names, and per-field public-profile visibility.
- Added inspect-before-restore version history to Image and Video Editor projects, including lazy previews, change summaries, actor attribution, named checkpoints, exact pre-restore recovery points, conflict handling, cover preservation, and revision-owned media. Migration 082 adds revision-media ownership tables and bounded backfill state.
- Added a machine-checked API and schema compatibility retirement registry with exact ownership, introduction history, replacement and migration decisions, normalized consumer evidence, a 90-day and two-stable-release sunset floor, and fail-closed OpenAPI removal gates.
- Added final-image SPDX SBOM and full vulnerability-report artifacts to candidate and release workflows, a separately enforced pinned-scanner gate for fixable high and critical findings, and digest evidence that binds each report to the exact promoted image.
- Added continuous Go and TypeScript reachability, documentation-graph, provider-fact, canonical public-route, and release-surface ownership checks with explicit roots and narrow exceptions.
- Added a complete feature hub and canonical FAQ grouped around verified product scope, current provider-certification evidence, plan and provider limits, maintained proof, and contextual documentation and support paths.
- Added a complete, audited workspace-access lifecycle with server-enforced admin, editor, and viewer permissions; active and inactive accepted members; atomic seat and pending-invitation limits; role changes, deactivation, restoration, removal, resend, revoke, search, and filters; last-admin safeguards; and an admin-only access history. Migration 080 preserves existing access as active and adds the lifecycle and audit schema.
- Added accessible password reveal controls and exact Unicode-aware server rules, preserved safe protected deep links through authentication, documented the fixed session lifetime instead of adding a cosmetic persistence toggle, and expanded authenticator enrollment into a six-step flow with a copyable manual key, resilient verification, and explicit enabled-factor confirmation.
- Added permission-aware failed-payment recovery with an account-wide notice and billing-page action that mints a fresh exact-subscription Paddle payment-method link; migration 079 preserves the first past-due transition and atomically fences stale, repeated, and out-of-order provider snapshots until newer active truth clears the restriction.
- Added an evidence-based provider-readiness ledger and runtime controls that bind approval, account authorization, policy mode, output profile, app identity, environment, contract digest, and expiring live proof; REST, MCP, CLI, composer, worker, release, and public-claim surfaces now fail closed from the same projection, with migration 077 preserving immutable evidence.
- Added a machine-checked managed-data retention schedule, complete first-party browser-storage inventory, dated legal-policy history, and reviewed security responsibility and incident-disclosure boundaries without implying independent assurance that has not occurred.
- Added automatic, reviewable image alt text when images without alt text are attached in the text-and-thread composer. The optional server-side OpenRouter integration sends a 400px JPEG thumbnail and, when present, up to 1,000 characters of the current relevant post or thread segment as untrusted context for better disambiguation; it never replaces user-written text or blocks media attachment and publishing when unavailable.
- Added durable provider-write fencing with immutable logical payload fingerprints, structured acceptance and reconciliation state, provider idempotency support, stale-worker ambiguity recovery, and no-replay crash protection across publishing, comments, messages, reposts, and media delivery; migration 076 adds the attempt ledger.
- Added a dated managed-service trust register that names current data locations, required and feature-triggered service providers, user-directed recipients, transfer facts and open reviews, and the exact human production-access boundary without implying certifications that do not exist.
- Added acknowledgement-gated authenticator setup with hashed, single-use recovery codes that are shown once, protected remaining-count and replacement flows, recovery-code sign-in, and automatic revocation when the factor is replaced or disabled; migration 072 adds the recovery-code store.
- Added normalized, encrypted provider authorization grants shared by sibling destinations, with atomic rotating-token refresh, revocation state, lossless migration, workspace isolation, and explicit destination-only versus saved-authorization removal; migration 073 adds the grant store.
- Added immutable, hash-only publication authorization receipts for scheduled, immediate, retry, reply, and compatibility publication writes, with exact actor provenance, revision and destination binding, fail-closed publisher preflight, legacy queue repair, and redacted audit/export behavior; migration 075 adds the receipt store and immutability guards.

### Changed

- Consolidated REST and MCP publication updates, rendition replacement, validation, scheduling, immediate publishing, and REST retry orchestration behind a shared application command/query boundary, with matching workspace authorization and enqueue validation.
- Pinned the production Bun toolchain, Node frontend builder, Go backend builder, and supported Alpine runtime inputs by digest; kept Vite and SvelteKit on real Node while Bun owns installs and scripts; declared Linux AMD64 as the tested container architecture; separated process liveness from traffic readiness; and expanded restart smoke coverage across OCI health, configuration, SQLite, FFmpeg, FFprobe, and release identity.
- Replaced three full shared-asset copies with a typed per-surface manifest that validates every source reference and staged output before installing the exact frontend, documentation, or marketing files.
- Made one canonical marketing route manifest own prerender entries, sitemap priorities, canonical URLs, and social metadata, including bidirectional page and content-catalog checks.
- Made release planning classify every maintained path by application, site, delivery, launch, agent-tool, asset, or repository ownership, with only documented reference-checkout exemptions.
- Replaced stale contributor design instructions with canonical guidance links and made launch, documentation, assets, and public provider-count copy agree with the backend catalogue.
- Added source, owner, evidence basis, review date, recheck deadline, and plan or region qualifier to every mutable comparison row, with a freshness check that fails when evidence expires.
- Put plan audience, exact limits, trial renewal behavior, cancellation, billing management, refunds, tax, and Paddle's Merchant of Record role beside managed-plan choices; billing-period changes now preserve focus and use one concise live announcement.
- Defined `server.json` as the immutable Official MCP Registry listing version, documented its compatibility policy separately from application and negotiated protocol versions, and made registry drift fail repository and release planning checks.
- Standardized the application, marketing site, and shared previews on the supported `@lucide/svelte` package, removed the duplicate legacy dependency, and replaced legacy icon-constructor annotations with a Svelte 5 component contract.
- Removed confirmed unused frontend helper exports and convenience types after proving no static, namespace, dynamic, glob, or package-export consumer remained.
- Removed unused drawer and scroll-area UI primitives, duplicate sidebar constants, empty frontend barrels, and the now-unneeded `vaul-svelte` dependency after proving the shipped import graph no longer reaches them.
- Made each new CLI authorization request expire older pending device sessions, and made transactional workspace deletion the sole owner of removing that workspace's media-cleanup jobs.
- Removed obsolete CLI post-write and API-token creation wrappers, and kept MCP stdio framing helpers private to the production proxy implementation.
- Removed confirmed unreachable backend and CLI helper APIs after verifying the supported runtime and test entry points remain unchanged.
- Moved destination-preview coverage into the shared social-preview package and removed the unused application wrapper.
- Removed unreachable pre-Trash media deletion and overflow posting-time helpers after preserving their database-ordering and scheduling assertions on the active lifecycle paths.
- Restored the original expressive landing hero, floating provider field, customer-logo rail, rotating result previews, and complete provider-icon definitions after product review; retained larger mobile platform-guide targets and the confirmed unreachable-code cleanup.
- Removed tracked backend import-probe commands and the unused authentication-only middleware whose name incorrectly implied workspace authorization.
- Made one validated legal-policy manifest drive the hosted Terms, Privacy, and Refund Policy dates, versions, URLs, acceptance rules, public pages, generated backend constants, cloud startup checks, and release gates so substantive Terms or Privacy changes reliably re-prompt existing accounts.
- Stamped each immutable release candidate from one strict stable-version and full-revision manifest, verified that identity across image labels, the embedded file, runtime metadata, artifact download, digest-only promotion, and deployed version checks, and blocked promotion on any mismatch.
- Replaced the nested payment dialog with a standalone responsive checkout page and kept Paddle's hosted fields on a contrast-safe light payment canvas in both app themes.
- Reworded checkout consent copy to name the actual payment-submit action instead of a nonexistent continue step, since the hosted payment form loads inline automatically.
- Hidden the customer-portal action when the workspace has no billing subscription, so a dead portal request cannot surface without a plan; plan selection remains the primary no-subscription action.
- Rebuilt the marketing landing and pricing pages with paired light and dark surfaces, a viewport-safe product-video dialog, richer destination previews, a collapsible creator-workflow mosaic, animated yearly pricing, and an interactive follower-growth planner.
- Grouped Social Set destination icons into clear overlapping avatar stacks, kept overflow counts beside the icons, and standardized shared checkbox styling and optional toggle sounds across app and menu surfaces.

### Fixed

- Updated OpenTelemetry Go to 1.41.0 to fix CVE-2026-29181 in crafted multi-value baggage-header handling.
- Made the provider-catalog fact check resolve shared platform limits in a clean checkout before SvelteKit generates its aliases, preserved the dead-code check's executable mode for clean CI runners, and removed the final unreachable post-service helper it exposed.
- Restored release-gate browser fixtures for provider readiness and canonical publication summaries, and fixed documentation-link and production-image manifest script checks.
- Pinned every external action used by the Star History workflow to a reviewed full commit so the workflow satisfies the repository supply-chain policy.
- Migration 084 retires required-SSO organization-wide app tokens, normalizes existing `allow` policies to workspace-scoped access, and limits the policy API and settings UI to one assured workspace or denial. Existing unbound tokens are not assigned to a workspace and can no longer access required-SSO resources; revoke them and issue one assured token per workspace.
- Aligned scoped automation across Huma and the authenticated upload-session content route, kept OpenPost credentials off presigned storage hosts, enforced required-SSO and workspace boundaries across REST, MCP, and CLI access paths, and made `cli:full` account and organization behavior explicit.
- Required a signed-in browser for CLI and MCP device approval and general instance administration, while retaining only typed provider-certification test operations for deliberate unscoped instance-admin automation.
- Enforced the same scope, workspace, and required-SSO checks for header and query-token media access, kept credential-served media out of shared caches, and limited public signed-media caching to the signature lifetime.
- Migration 083 replaces request-time legacy authoring sweeps with aggregate-scoped translation and a resumable bounded backfill that repairs indexed publication job identities, preserves authorization provenance across REST and MCP, and keeps authoring query counts independent of unrelated history.
- Gave local, Capacitor, Turbo, and Docker frontend builds one repository-owned Node heap contract so large Vite builds no longer inherit conflicting 4 GiB limits.
- Made PostgreSQL migration preparation normalize multiline `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` statements idempotently, preventing fresh-schema bootstrap from aborting when the Bun bootstrap already created a newer column.
- Prevented text-and-thread drafts, media, and schedules from crossing workspace boundaries by requiring save, stay, or discard decisions with origin-scoped race guards; scheduling and publishing failures now retain exact destination, segment, and field targets, focus the affected control, and remain retryable after authoritative revalidation.
- Unified marketing route errors and the static-host 404 around one branded recovery source with product, documentation, email, and community paths that remain usable without application assets.
- Clarified that screen recordings remain local to the current browser until the user explicitly saves them to cloud storage, Media, or a post handoff.
- Restored direct image paste in the text-and-thread composer with an immediate local preview and ordered in-place upload instead of a media-picker modal; progress, cancellation, retry, validation feedback, bounded concurrency, destination changes, navigation, and teardown now preserve or safely discard transient uploads without leaking them into draft payloads.
- Enforced the fixed media lifecycle as 14 days for unused temporary media and seven days in Trash, kept legacy cleanup fields as ignored compatibility inputs, computed protected references once per bounded batch, and added migration 078's media-leading index for constant-query cleanup on SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- Made each JavaScript workspace own its build output, added an atomic and crash-recoverable frontend packaging boundary, proved clean and cached frontend artifacts are identical, included documentation in the root build, and made app browser tests serve the packaged artifact.
- Limited CI package-write permission to the production-image job and added a release-contract regression that prevents broader jobs from gaining it.
- Kept tagged releases as reusable drafts until all candidate evidence and every server, CLI, MCP, and Android artifact are complete, the exact candidate digest is promoted and deployed, and public readiness passes; final publication now verifies the complete asset set, while maintained workflow Actions use verified full-commit pins with weekly update checks.
- Aligned provider-application administration guidance with the live instance-admin UI and API, documented encrypted secret ownership and source precedence, and rejected administrator rows that cannot become effective runtime configuration.
- Pinned managed automatic image-caption requests to the verified `azure/eu` OpenRouter route, disabled provider fallbacks, denied provider data collection, and required a zero-data-retention endpoint; cloud startup now fails closed if that policy drifts.
- Bounded calendar, planner, and activity reads with canonical publication date ranges, stable cursors, complete pagination, and workspace/date-scoped refresh coalescing so autosaves no longer hydrate full history.
- Added a permission-safe publication timeline for creation, edits, authorization attempts, and provider outcomes while suppressing raw metadata, provider messages, and idempotency details.
- Added the missing OpenPost Studio overview and made the documentation gate validate every configured VitePress navigation target as well as Markdown links.
- Restored composer round trips through both editors so draft text, destinations, schedule, existing media, cancellations, and destination-specific video variants return to the exact originating publication.
- Isolated the editor catalog by workspace and query, added independent paginated design and video results, and exposed permission-safe cloud-video deletion with consequence copy and optimistic rollback.
- Gave video previews editor-scoped Blob URL leases, stale-load guards, and bounded pressure cleanup that preserves active projects while reclaiming disposable artifacts.
- Unified publication creation for REST, MCP, and the CLI's REST client behind one transactional command so every content mode stores the same intent and creation preset, resolves the same destination capabilities, and remains a draft until explicitly scheduled or published.
- Made recurring media cleanup use exact workspace and dedupe identities, an active-job uniqueness constraint, and one crash-recoverable rescheduled job per workspace; migration 071 safely consolidates older duplicate cleanup chains while preserving completed history.
- Scoped notification inbox reads and bulk actions to the authorized selected workspace plus the account-wide notices shown there; synchronized the persistent bell and paginated feed through one workspace cache; kept failed reads, deletes, and page loads recoverable without changing unread truth; and added read filters, date groups, event labels, complete time semantics, and explicit row actions.
- Made the embedded app distinguish generated SPA routes from unknown documents, return a real 404 with an accessible recovery page for unknown routes, and generate the route manifest during production builds; precompiled Paraglide message modules also make production builds deterministic.
- Invalidated in-flight composer requests before navigation and teardown so canceled account, workspace, capability, destination-option, and scheduling reads cannot report or mutate stale screens.
- Made Starter, Founder, Pro, Team, and Agency selectable for monthly or annual billing across public pricing cards and comparisons, with plan-specific guidance and verified registration links at desktop and 320 px widths.
- Made draft navigation reuse prefetched canonical publication and composer data, removed legacy and duplicate capability request waterfalls, bounded publication detail queries across destinations, stopped duplicate shell and Posts page loads, and kept the planner sidebar stable during background autosave refreshes.
- Split legacy post media cache state from rendition-owned provider deliveries, enforced workspace-safe auxiliary-media relations, encrypted and redacted resumable upload sessions, and resumed interrupted YouTube uploads from provider-confirmed offsets across SQLite and PostgreSQL upgrades; migration 074 adds typed delivery ownership and relations.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Added tactile press and release sounds across raised buttons and common selection controls, plus reduced-motion-aware orange confetti when a post is scheduled.
- Added the current official Postiz social logo set, an image-led publishing workflow mosaic, and an animated product-demo dialog to the marketing site.

### Changed

- Kept the expanded planner sidebar and Calendar, Posts, Inbox, Analytics, and Media navigation consistent across authenticated routes, and eased raised-button press travel.
- Restored clickable five-second hero result rotation that stops after manual selection, simplified landing-page copy, and tightened pricing layouts.

### Fixed

- Preserve plan and destination context through Google signup and legal acceptance, remove duplicate workspace bootstrap redirects, and send existing Google users back to their intended destination instead of checkout.
- Keep payment entry inside an OpenPost checkout dialog with the active theme and plan summary, while Paddle continues to securely host the sensitive payment fields.
- Constrain hosted Paddle catalog prices to one subscription unit so checkout no longer offers duplicate copies of the same plan.
- Fixed SQLite upgrades from versions before 1.1.16 by rebuilding populated legacy post tables safely when migration 038 adds the draft revision timestamp.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Added responsive pointer-reactive platform and AI marks plus project-owned ENF., The Actual World, Uni's Easy, ARC Gym, Ark, Dias Solutions, Montra, and Unprompted identity assets to the marketing hero.
- Added a privacy-aware YouTube product-tour section and clearly labeled illustrative creator workflows with original generated portraits.

### Changed

- Simplified the marketing hero around the “Your socials, on steroids.” promise, one raised trial action, the three illustrative result views, and a broader customer logo rail.
- Reworked the full landing-page sequence around the product demo, a tighter publishing loop, alternating product proof, creator workflows, plans, and a direct closing action; removed the separate platform-chip band and carousel controls below the result phones.
- Gave shared buttons, selects, comboboxes, badges, and tag inputs a faster raised orange interaction language, with optional interface-sound feedback on raised controls and a marketing-site sound toggle.

### Fixed

- Initialized delegated interface sounds on the marketing site so raised-button feedback plays before navigation instead of remaining silent outside the authenticated app.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Added grouped recovery queues for publication and engagement collection failures, analytics coverage denominators and highlights, searchable settings navigation, and read-only details for published publications.
- Completed the Image Editor command registry across desktop and mobile menus, tool rails, tooltips, shortcuts, handlers, checked states, and disabled explanations.
- Added adaptive cached alpha hit testing, Alt-click layer cycling, a visible Select layer menu, and floating pixel resize, rotation, and duplicate controls.
- Added one cancellable RGBA scan contract for magic selection, bucket fill, and magic erase, including transparent/global/contiguous semantics, previews, progress, locked-target guidance, and large-image limits.
- Added Image Editor export memory budgeting, cancellation, and resumable page-level Media/composer uploads without duplicating successful assets.

### Changed

- Rebuilt the marketing hero around illustrative cross-network result views, floating social icons, a raised trial action, and a customer logo ticker while keeping the existing product promise and plan terms.
- Simplified the text composer with contextual inspiration, a dedicated post-settings sheet for repost behavior, automatic URL recognition, and a device-first media chooser with clearer source tabs and upload guidance.
- Made the desktop planner contextual to authoring and calendar routes, reduced the primary navigation to five workflow destinations, and separated diagnostic job records from failed-publication totals.
- Reworked the desktop sidebar into a calm task stack with a stable brand and compose action, compact workspace and notification controls, three recent drafts, and one readable destination list.
- Made instance release status show the configured source, effective running value, edition override, and pending-restart state together.
- Unified Image Editor canvas, template, preview, download, Media, and composer-return rendering on the same Fabric adapter and added browser pixel-parity checks.
- Made Image Editor history restore the active page, object and pixel selection, tool, zoom, and pan while avoiding a redundant post-command document clone.

### Fixed

- Updated SvelteKit and Nano ID to their patched security releases and pinned the transitive versions used by the workspace.
- Kept the marketing changelog page's server data typed with the current SvelteKit load contract.
- Kept workspace names available to the sidebar switcher and counted failed background jobs in the Activity failure tab.
- Prevented the managed public home from flashing for signed-in sessions and stopped photo-only stock providers from offering video searches.
- Fixed stored conversation history loading, added missing-conversation handling and retry UX, generated request IDs, and kept the reply composer hidden until history loads.
- Made Media Library and instance-user searches submit reliably with Enter, added applied-query state, clear search, and Media result counts.
- Disabled settings save actions until their forms contain changes and corrected singular analytics destination copy.
- Fixed Threads location customization by waiting for a search term, using the provider's `q` parameter, requesting `threads_location_tagging`, and returning reconnection guidance when an existing account lacks that scope.
- Made Image Editor multi-selection show mixed transform and opacity values, apply compatible values to every unlocked root, and report skipped layers; missing fonts and page media now expose recovery actions.
- Completed nested Image Editor group movement with cycle-safe drag-into targets, keyboard/context move-out actions, inherited lock protection, ancestor-bound repair, and undo restoration.
- Preserved floating pixels across save, project, template, and export boundaries, and added recoverable handling for corrupt or missing local media, quota errors, concurrent tabs, and revision conflicts.
- Made Image Editor conflict reloads preserve local work as a separately titled cloud design before loading the newer server revision, with visible failure recovery.
- Added signed-in project-import cancellation and resume, stylus palm rejection, touch pinch routing, dialog/sheet focus restoration, keyboard-only export coverage, and Portuguese browser-zoom proof.

- Preserve plan and destination context through Google signup and legal acceptance, remove duplicate workspace bootstrap redirects, and send existing Google users back to their intended destination instead of checkout.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added destination-aware video frame selection for Instagram Reel covers, TikTok cover timestamps, and YouTube thumbnails, including direct thumbnail and caption-file uploads from destination settings.
- Defaulted new TikTok destinations to Direct Post while keeping inbox Upload as an explicit choice.
- Completed the Image Editor crop session with independent frame and image positioning, transient rotate and flip controls, exact cancel rollback, and one-command apply history.
- Added a true 9 by 9 canvas-eyedropper magnifier with transparent edge cells, one- or ten-pixel keyboard movement, Enter sampling, and exact color-coordinate announcements.
- Added bounded Image Editor file preflight for MIME, bytes, decoded dimensions, pixel and layer budgets, and unsafe SVG content, with mixed-batch progress, isolated failures, failed-file retry, and page-thumbnail drop targeting.
- Applied one zoom-correct snapping contract to Image Editor object transforms, crop handles, guides, and gradient endpoints, with active-axis guides and Command/Control bypass.

### Fixed

- Allowed resource-sensitive app browser gates to serialize Playwright workers without slowing the default CI configuration.
- Updated the pinned YAML parser to the patched release for CVE-2026-59870.
- Prevented X analytics from replacing complete snapshots with partial batch results and added a 24-hour backoff when X API credits are depleted.
- Derived relative local media URLs from the canonical public app origin so pull-from-URL providers receive an absolute media URL without duplicate deployment configuration.
- Made Escape cancel a crop exactly even when focus remains on the tool rail or another button.
- Prevented unsupported dropped files from being silently ignored, async imports from landing on a newly selected page, and completed import batches from retaining large browser `File` references.
- Kept overlapping 44 px crop targets predictable on small images and made snapping tolerance remain ten screen pixels at every CSS zoom level.

## [3.3.1] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added a floating pixel-selection mode in the Image Editor so selected pixels can be moved before committing, with Enter/Escape/Delete workflows, arrow-key nudging, undo labeling, and cancel-safe rollback.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added a source-grounded Image Editor completeness checklist covering interaction, history, persistence, renderer, responsive, accessibility, performance, recovery, and test requirements.
- Added persistent desktop and mobile Image Editor object-snapping controls with an accessible status announcement and Command/Control-drag temporary bypass.
- Added external image and SVG drops to the Image Editor canvas with exact placement, ordered multi-file cascading, guest OPFS storage, Media Library retention, progress, and error feedback.
- Added an interactive Image Editor crop mode with a dimmed rule-of-thirds frame, pointer and keyboard controls, social aspect presets, rotated/flipped layer geometry, reset, cancel, and single-command undo/redo.
- Added a typed Image Editor command and shortcut registry that drives keyboard dispatch, platform-aware menu labels, the complete help reference, and shortcut-collision tests.
- Added a canvas eyedropper with active-layer or composited-page sampling, pointer color/alpha preview, recent colors, and explicit paint, selected fill/text, selected stroke, or page-background targets.
- Exposed saved brand backgrounds and whole-layer brand text styles directly in the Image Editor with revision-safe snapshots and one-command multi-text-layer application.
- Added selection-content actions that project document masks into transformed image or paint layer space, delete selected pixels non-destructively, or promote them to a new editable layer with one undo entry.
- Added pressure-aware, smoothed freehand drawing with coalesced pen input, persisted tool options, and a live document-scale brush cursor.
- Added page-specific rulers and persistent pointer/keyboard/numeric guides, configurable grid display and spacing, guide/grid snapping, and live document coordinates without including editor chrome in exports.
- Added portable `.openpost-image` project export and import with bundled source media, validation, path and size limits, ID remapping, new-design creation, and guest or workspace media migration.
- Added persisted text underline, strikethrough, and word or character wrapping, plus explicit shape no-fill/no-stroke controls and aspect-locked numeric sizing.
- Added an explicit, undoable restore action for non-destructive image erase masks.

- Added an OpenPost-native media chooser with device selection, drag and drop, file paste, camera capture, local image and video thumbnails, per-file size and progress, cancel and retry controls, and actionable validation and upload errors.
- Added provider-aware stock-media filters for orientation, size, color, language, order, content safety, collections, image type, category, Editor's Choice, and minimum dimensions where each configured provider supports them.

### Changed

- Removed Uppy and moved the Media page, composer, Image Editor, Video Editor, workspace image, and profile-picture flows onto shared OpenPost controls; profile pictures now include a square crop preview and upload progress.
- Combined Library, Device, Camera, Stock, and editor creation in one media-picker surface, with stock providers labeled by their actual photo and video support.
- Reduced test-suite overhead by removing assertion-free and duplicate checks and by running viewport-independent marketing contracts once instead of once per browser size.
- Added the standalone video-project unit suite to the default local and CI test gates.
- Added a maintained miniPaint source reference and an implementation-level Image Editor parity ledger covering tools, precision controls, persistence, accessibility, and adoption priorities.

### Fixed

- Prevented no-op Image Editor mutations from dirtying a design, clearing redo history, or consuming an undo entry.
- Made Image Editor image and paint hit testing click through transparent pixels after transformed bounds filtering.
- Kept selected-pixel promotion from restoring pixels removed by earlier freehand erase masks, reduced contiguous color-selection memory use, and made pixel cut create an independently movable layer with a transparent source hole.
- Made image replacement preserve its transform, normalized crop, adjustments, masks, and effects; kept locked layers safe from bulk deletion; and selected the nearest editable layer afterward.
- Added cancellation and remaining-file retry to external image-drop batches without duplicating files that were already inserted.
- Made Image Editor, Video Editor, and workspace-image uploads use library retention so newly uploaded reusable media remains visible after the picker refreshes and reopens.
- Corrected upload guidance to show the backend's actual 16 GiB video limit and 50 MB image and audio limit.
- Corrected the Image Editor guide to include paint layers and freehand drawing and to distinguish stored brand backgrounds and text styles from the colors and fonts currently exposed in the editor.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added filename editing for images, videos, audio, and other Media assets, plus right-click renaming for image designs and cloud video projects on Editors.

### Changed

- Removed logo and brand-asset roles from brand kits while keeping colors, backgrounds, text styles, and licensed fonts.
- Made two-finger trackpad scrolling pan the Image Editor canvas and reduced pinch-zoom sensitivity.

### Fixed

- Made public app pages answer `HEAD` requests with their normal status and headers so payment-provider domain verification does not treat the live site as unreachable.
- Allowed media referenced by failed publications to move to Trash even when a child rendition still has a pre-publish status, while keeping active drafts, schedules, and publishing work protected.
- Removed the unintended divider lines immediately above and below the Media search and filter controls.
- Made new text layers start with “New text,” prevented the T shortcut from typing into the layer it creates, kept later text dragging out of edit mode, and stopped multi-selection snapping from moving selected layers off-canvas.
- Kept SVG conversion automatic while replacing the backend's manual-conversion instruction with a processing error for clients that bypass the supported upload flow.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- Replaced the Media page, composer, and editor asset-picker upload paths with one styled Uppy dialog for files, camera capture, stock providers, OpenPost Library selection, and image or video preparation.
- Simplified Media around Library, hidden-by-default Temporary uploads, and seven-day Trash, with direct favorite controls and focused filters for reusable assets.

### Fixed

- Kept Google sign-in from the sign-up page out of new-account checkout when the Google identity already belongs to an OpenPost account with a workspace, while preserving onboarding and selected plan details for first-time accounts.
- Kept media last-use timestamps accurate when posts, publication renditions, image designs, or video projects attach or detach files, and stopped published or failed posts and deleted editor projects from blocking media cleanup.
- Converted browser SVG uploads to PNG before storage and rejected unconverted SVG input so unsupported vector assets cannot break the Image Editor.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Made the media lifecycle migration preserve historical brand assets when their upload hash already belongs to a library item, so PostgreSQL upgrades do not violate workspace deduplication.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Show the profile owner's highest active OpenPost plan beside their handle on public profiles.
- Added provider-driven required fields and format validation to the composer for every supported destination.
- Added a shared design-font catalog to both editors, fifteen varied Image Editor starter templates, keyboard nudging, edge and center snapping while moving, and canvas-aware snapping while resizing.
- Added a combined Editors hub for image designs and video projects, plus separate Library, Temporary, and seven-day Trash views for workspace media.

### Changed

- Made the OpenPost Video Editor available on every instance and removed its environment and database-backed feature toggle.
- Changed the OpenPost wordmark from Geist to Manrope Semibold across the canonical lockups, GitHub README, app shell, public headers, marketing chrome, and dynamic social previews while retaining Geist for interface copy.
- Replaced the post-type and composer-experience choices with one text-and-thread composer that infers destination formats, asks only for ambiguous Instagram and Facebook formats, keeps direct account tabs for preview and customization, combines Social Sets with account selection, and moves repost overrides into Advanced delivery.
- Unified OpenPost Media, upload and camera capture, stock providers, and editor creation in the reusable media picker used by the composer and Image Editor; also made the Image Editor's mobile tools, inspector, first-edit guidance, help, and guest export flow more compact and direct.
- Reworked media retention so post-specific uploads are temporary, active drafts, schedules, retries, designs, video projects, tags, favorites, and brand roles protect their files, successful publications move unprotected temporary media to Trash immediately, and idle temporary media moves there after 14 days.
- Kept logos and other brand assets in the normal reusable Media library while Settings assigns their brand roles; editable projects now live in Editors instead of being mixed into the asset grid.

### Fixed

- Kept Video Editor text visible in preview and export, stacked simultaneous timeline items into collision-safe named lanes, delayed recording project creation until capture starts, and added clear storage, import, picker, destructive-action, and mobile tool feedback.
- Made the README brand lockup use a white wordmark in GitHub dark mode while retaining the carbon wordmark in light mode.
- Made the managed app root publicly reviewable without JavaScript by exposing a concise product description, current monthly plan prices, trial terms, and direct Terms, Privacy, and Refund links, while preserving the signed-in composer and the self-hosted landing experience.
- Tightened public profiles into a compact, content-sized layout, expanded the yearly activity field to its available width, and simplified ranking lists.
- Fixed Image Editor fit-to-canvas calculations, initial Media loading, layer renaming, 320 px undo and redo access, stock-photo empty-state copy, and platform-specific shortcut labels.
- Made media deletion preserve historical post metadata, block every active normalized post, rendition, design, template, video-project, and brand reference, and allow recovery before permanent blob removal.
- Kept legacy Studio links on the public Image Editor redirect path and preserved the desktop sidebar's paired workspace navigation after adding Editors.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Added a durable personal Composer setting that switches between the default spacious text-and-thread plus focused-media experience and one unified rendition-first composer for every starter preset; both edit the same publications and account versions.
- Added reusable Social Sets with ordered account membership, a workspace default, optional per-account format defaults, composer management, and destination snapshots that stay stable when a set changes or is deleted.
- Added per-destination format locks, nullable text and media inheritance, reset controls, destination schedule overrides, and declarative format choices and segment strategies.
- Added ten image-generated Converge header directions, each delivered in platform-safe X and LinkedIn profile sizes with the exact OpenPost vector lockup, plus a primary slogan-led pair for X and LinkedIn.

### Changed

- Unified Post, Thread, Story, Short video, and Video under one publication-and-rendition workflow while preserving the spacious text-and-thread writing canvas as the default composer experience; drafts use shared All channels content, account tabs, destination-specific settings, and canonical `/publications/:id` editing, and linked historical post URLs redirect there.
- Changed creation modes into starter presets, stopped filtering accounts by a global mode, and made every selected account keep its own visible, independently validated rendition.
- Replaced active Whop billing with Paddle Merchant of Record billing: localized Paddle.js checkout, sandbox and production isolation, mirrored customers and subscriptions, a Paddle-native billing schema, Paddle-scoped entitlements, raw-body signed webhooks with canonical reconciliation, scheduled-cancellation access, fresh customer portal sessions, configuration, CLI, policies, and operator documentation.
- Replaced the pen identity with the four-module OpenPost Converge mark across the app, marketing site, documentation, favicons, Android assets, social previews, and downloadable social kit; adopted “Publish clearly.” as the optional short brand line.
- Replaced the pen-era social header explorations with dark Converge banners for X and LinkedIn, using image-generated physical brand environments, the exact vector lockup, and the new primary line “Turn what you’re building into content. Publish it everywhere.”

### Breaking

- Replaced the Whop billing API, webhook, configuration keys, and subscription integration with Paddle. Cloud operators must configure the complete `OPENPOST_PADDLE_*` set and the `/api/v1/billing/paddle/webhook` notification destination before upgrading. Existing Whop subscription rows are retained as historical data but do not grant Paddle-backed entitlements; migrate active customers through Paddle before deploying this release.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Added image-generated dark X and LinkedIn profile headers built around the real OpenPost workspace and a restrained OpenPost pen mark.
- Added nine image-generated dark X header concepts spanning cinematic, typographic, real-world, graphic, sculptural, layered, spatial, and human brand directions.
- Added release planning, exact local release checks, candidate and production status reporting, a public running-version endpoint, immutable SHA image smoke tests, and configuration-only startup validation.

### Changed

- Keep Accounts beside Settings in the expanded workspace sidebar navigation instead of using a separate footer row.
- Allowed instance administrators to override allowlisted environment-backed configuration values with encrypted database settings, with clear pending and active override labels and a one-click return to the environment value.
- Migrated the JavaScript workspace, Devenv commands, Docker build, CI, release packaging, Android build, and contributor documentation from pnpm to Bun with a committed text lockfile and age-gated dependency installs.
- Changed releases to run the full matrix in parallel on `main`, publish one immutable tested image, and promote that same image on tags instead of repeating tag-time checks and builds.
- Changed production deployment to accept a signed revision, tag, and digest, validate the candidate against production configuration, verify the running revision, and restore the previous image automatically when startup or readiness fails.
- Development backend runs, tests, vulnerability scans, and lint now use a filesystem-backed frontend build tag; only production builds embed frontend assets and use a disposable Go build cache.

### Fixed

- Made production-image smoke tests use an isolated Docker volume so the non-root server can create its database on Linux runners, and print container logs when startup exits early.
- Kept the desktop platform menu at its intended wide layout by overriding the shared navigation content width with component-scoped CSS.
- Updated marketing browser coverage to verify the publishing-activity proof that replaced the previous proof-card copy.
- Fixed profile-picture uploads to S3-compatible storage by sending small objects with an explicit size and a seekable body. The uploader now shows the server's real error instead of Uppy's generic network warning.
- Stabilized Video Editor release checks with deterministic, fully encoded WebM fixtures for analysis imports and switched recording segments.
- Kept release checks reproducible on fresh Linux runners by installing their pinned browser and media-fixture dependencies, preserving executable script modes, and bounding the fully parallel app browser suite to two workers.
- Added a daily, configurable 4 GiB safety cap for the repository-local Go build cache and removed forced Go test-cache invalidation that made repeated checks slower without addressing embedded-asset growth.
- Updated vulnerable Bun resolutions and made the security gate reject every new runtime advisory while documenting the remaining upstream-only development-tool exceptions.
- Made release checks fail before long-running work when disk, Docker responsiveness and memory, GitHub access, deployment secrets, or production readiness are unavailable; reclaim and bound unused local BuildKit cache when disk is tight; excluded dependencies, Devenv state, prior embeds, generated Android assets, and local media from Docker build contexts; isolated browser-suite servers from stale local processes; and restored the original changelog when local release verification fails.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Made repost sweep scheduling idempotent when a pending sweep already exists, so restarts do not fail on the queue's uniqueness guard.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Included the documentation catalog and social-image package in the Docker frontend build context, and raised the builder heap to match the production frontend gate, so release images can generate synchronized assets and complete the bundle.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Added tag-based Media organization with many tags per file, multi-tag and Untagged filters, image, video, and audio type filters, sorting, drag-and-drop upload, bulk tag assignment, and the same controls in media pickers and both editors. New uploads remain untagged unless the user explicitly uploads into an active tag.
- Added a ready-to-use OpenPost social kit with X and LinkedIn banners, profile images, post formats, a five-slide carousel, story layouts, blank templates, campaign copy, and accessible alt text.
- Added declarative route-specific Open Graph and X card images for every marketing and documentation page, rendered on demand by a versioned Cloudflare Pages image endpoint instead of stored per-page files.
- Added per-event in-app and email notification settings for publishing outcomes, account attention, conversations, failed replies, and workspace invitations, with durable deduplicated email delivery through the configured SMTP, Resend, or Cloudflare provider.
- Added durable native auto repost rules for X, Mastodon, Bluesky, and LinkedIn, with source and target account selection, delays, evaluation windows, minimum likes/comments/reposts/views, all-or-any gates, plateau checks, per-post inherit/off/custom overrides, and revocable cross-workspace target grants.

### Changed

- Renamed Studio and Video Studio to OpenPost Image Editor and OpenPost Video Editor across product copy, source names, configuration, APIs, assets, and canonical URLs. Existing `/studio` and `/video-studio` links redirect to the matching editor route.
- Changed the editor API paths from `/api/v1/studio` and `/api/v1/video-studio` to `/api/v1/image-editor` and `/api/v1/video-editor`. API clients must update these paths. Existing editor environment variables remain temporary read aliases, and migration 063 converts stored editor settings, media provenance, project modes, Creator plan settings, checkout attempts, and subscriptions to their new canonical names.
- Reworked the marketing navigation with a logo-led platform menu and replaced the footer activity grid with a compact single-row publishing pulse.
- Added local Git-ignored Postiz and Shoutrrr reference checkouts and contributor guidance to consult their current scheduler implementations when designing related features.

## [1.52.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Improved app E2E coverage reliability by aligning onboarding/register assertions to the active checkout flow, hardening the custom Mastodon connection path, and stabilizing media/communications test fixtures for deterministic execution.

## [1.52.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Added an OpenPost-owned embedded Whop checkout with monthly and annual plan selection, exact card-required 14-day trial terms, signed webhook reconciliation, local checkout-attempt mapping, and Whop membership management links.
- Added all Whop billing credentials and plan IDs to the encrypted instance-admin Configuration screen, with write-only secrets, environment precedence, and restart status.
- Added a guided first-account connection flow with OAuth trust details, a three-step activation cue, and a one-time reduced-motion-aware confetti and success-sound celebration.

### Changed

- Rebuilt Full Studio around a CapCut-style four-zone workspace with a dominant canvas, grouped creation tools, selection-specific inspector tabs, concise action-first copy, consistent panel gutters, a draggable multi-track timeline, and direct seeking on the timeline ruler instead of a separate progress slider.
- Replaced Polar billing with Whop across the backend, frontend, CLI, generated contracts, configuration, legal copy, and operator documentation. Cloud operators must configure the Whop API key, account, product, webhook secret, checkout return URL, and all ten monthly and annual plan IDs before upgrading.
- Changed managed pricing to USD-first plans: Starter $15/month or $150/year, Founder $25/$250, Pro $49/$490, Team $99/$990, and Agency $199/$1,990, each with a card-required 14-day trial.
- Simplified registration and workspace onboarding, moved plan payment into the OpenPost checkout screen, and removed the username and workspace-name decisions from the critical path.
- Reworked the marketing homepage, pricing page, navigation, product metadata, and signup proof around the managed product and interactive demo; self-hosting remains available through documentation and footer links instead of the primary conversion path.
- Repositioned OpenPost as the all-in-one content team for solo founders, centered on turning company work into content and publishing it everywhere rather than competing as another scheduler.

### Removed

- Removed the Polar configuration and compatibility path. Migration 060 replaces the unused hosted billing tables with the Whop membership and checkout schema.

## [1.51.2] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Updated vulnerable transitive `brace-expansion` and `postcss` releases used by production dependency paths.

## [1.51.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Updated the marketing browser contract to match the rebuilt homepage title on desktop and mobile.

## [1.51.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added an instance-admin Configuration screen for optional account, email, authentication, feature, provider behavior, and provider-app settings, with encrypted database values, write-only secrets, environment precedence, validation, fallback controls, and explicit restart status.
- Added six-digit email confirmation for email-and-password registration with provider-neutral SMTP, Resend, and Cloudflare Email Service delivery, plus resend throttling, attempt limits, expiry, and one-time use.
- Added first-party Google sign-in and explicit Google account linking through account security settings without unsafe email-based auto-linking.
- Added required unique usernames and opt-in public publishing profiles with yearly activity, lifetime and peak post counts, current and longest streaks, and top platform and workspace summaries.
- Added a complete touch editor for Video Studio phones with a compact timeline, bottom tool dock, contextual inspector sheets, and local export on capable browsers.
- Added configurable focus zooms, camera crop and presentation controls, reusable color-effect looks, batch transcript-word removal, and recording layout selection before capture.
- Added a reproducible one-hour 1080p60 Video Studio benchmark covering import, random seeks, playback rendering, request coalescing, proxy use, and decoder bounds.

### Changed

- Made email provider credentials optional at startup so administrators can configure delivery after installation; instances that require verification still block password registration until a transport is ready.
- Made direct and file-backed environment provider apps authoritative over matching administrator-managed database rows.
- Rebuilt the marketing homepage around the real OpenPost workflow and product surfaces, with scroll reveals, publishing-activity cells, and a shared animated footer used across marketing pages.
- Moved Quick Cut packet analysis, combined or per-section stream-copy export, and preview-proxy encoding off the UI thread; fast exports now stream directly to a selected file, preserve every supported audio track and source metadata, and reject tracks that cannot be preserved instead of dropping them.
- Made long-source artifact work staged and event-driven, with indexing, waveform, thumbnail, and proxy progress; serialized heavy work; storage preflight; cancellation, retry, proxy removal, and phase-level restart recovery.
- Added continuous recording storage-headroom checks and camera or microphone device-loss recovery, including automatic safe stop before browser storage is exhausted.

### Fixed

- Kept Post/Thread drafts open to multiple media attachments, then blocked publishing only for destinations whose current media rules reject the draft, refreshed Threads and LinkedIn multi-image limits, and honored each Mastodon instance's media count and MOV support.
- Kept hosted subscription fallback scoped to subscribed organizations the user owns or administers, so membership in another customer's organization cannot raise entitlements for an unrelated workspace.
- Batched large media cleanup jobs at the worker limit, removed workspace-scoped notifications during deletion, and hid the delete action from workspace editors and viewers.
- Kept visual overlays, detached audio, captions, markers, source offsets, fades, and animation keyframes aligned when Full Studio ripple-deletes clips, transcript cues, filler words, or silent sections.
- Fixed Quick Cut stream-copy export by preserving a compatible source container and supplying the packet reservation metadata required for MP4 fast start.
- Kept Quick Cut source boundaries on exact verified packet timestamps without project-frame rounding, and routed non-keyframe cuts to an explicit precise render instead of presenting them as lossless.
- Switched ordinary playback to the browser's native hardware video path while retaining exact worker-rendered paused frames, prevented slow long-source frames from repeatedly reopening the preview decoder, kept editor shortcuts out of sliders and form controls, and cleared stale transcript-word selections after caption replacement.
- Preserved OAuth callback errors through legacy account redirects and returned successful and failed connections to the embedded Accounts settings page.

## [1.50.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Fixed the sidebar Accounts active state comparison failing type checks in the shared marketing component tree.

## [1.50.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added a Delete workspace action in workspace general settings that removes the workspace, its members, posts, publications, accounts, media, schedules, prompts, and analytics, with media cleanup queued in the background.
- Added an Accounts entry to the sidebar that opens the settings accounts page.

### Changed

- Wrapped the accessible data table in analytics trend charts in a visually hidden container so it stays a screen-reader-only table.
- Hid the studio color picker screen eyedropper in browsers that do not support the EyeDropper API.

## [1.49.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Fixed Quick Cut source analysis failing before keyframes could be indexed, which left Fast export disabled, and suppressed secondary writable-stream cleanup errors during background artifact generation.
- Fixed new workspaces using Sunday instead of the declared Monday calendar default and made rolling calendar coverage stable on week-start boundary days.

## [1.49.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Added a Quick Cut workflow for single-source edits with source-scale kept sections, keyframe snapping, and local MP4 or WebM stream-copy export without video transcoding.
- Added one-click smooth zoom presets, word-level transcript ripple deletion, resizable timeline height, and camera recording layouts for circle, rounded, portrait, side-by-side, and full-frame compositions.

### Changed

- Reworked Video Studio into a dark, desktop editing workbench with an explicit Quick Cut or Full Studio choice, frame-coalesced timeline gestures, prioritized preview-proxy generation, and a two-hour project limit for long 1080p and 60 fps footage.

## [1.48.2] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Removed the abandoned duplicate changelog section from the failed v1.48.0 release attempt.

## [1.48.1] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- Moved connected social accounts into Settings as a first-class workspace category and redirected legacy account links into the new location.

### Fixed

- Updated browser coverage for the Settings-owned Accounts destination.

## [1.47.1] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Kept error toasts open until dismissed or retried and made every notification toast dismissible, and raised the workspace color picker to a touch-friendly height on small screens.
- Updated end-to-end coverage to the sonner notification surface and hardened the Studio shape-menu assertion against the mounted menubar menu.

## [1.47.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Added a reusable workspace color setting and applied it to workspace menus and calendar surfaces.

### Changed

- Reorganized settings around workspace, organization, and personal ownership, with social accounts and members under the workspace and plan usage and SSO under the organization.

### Fixed

- Warned before discarding meaningful unsaved settings, exposed instance administration from Social Accounts, kept the sidebar planner mounted between Engagement and Messages, and prevented stale Studio preview work from replacing a newly saved design thumbnail.
- Kept new workspaces in the owner's active subscribed organization, recovered existing owner-created workspaces that were split from that subscription, and aggregated hosted X API costs across the billed organization.

## [1.46.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Fixed feedback submission failing with a 503 on Postgres: the rate-limiter upsert referenced `request_count` unqualified inside `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, which Postgres rejects as ambiguous when the table is aliased by the query builder. Qualifying the references restores feedback delivery, and a Postgres-gated regression test covers the rate limiter path.

## [1.46.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Expanded writing prompts with a full example post for every built-in prompt, plus 30 new founder post prompts (Building in Public, Founder Story, Industry Commentary, Team & Culture, Lessons & Frameworks, and Engagement Starters categories) with ready-to-publish examples.
- Applying a writing prompt now fills the text-and-thread composer with the prompt's full example, and confirms with a dialog before replacing content the user already wrote. The composer's inspiration card shows the example and an Apply example button.
- Custom writing prompts can now include an optional example post that is inserted into the composer when applied.

## [1.45.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Added workspace creation from the desktop and mobile workspace switchers, with a focused name dialog that refreshes the workspace list and selects the new workspace immediately.
- Added anonymous, cookie-free Umami analytics to the public marketing and documentation sites while keeping the authenticated application untracked.
- Added the official OpenPost Discord community to the marketing navigation and footer, documentation navigation, and repository overview.

### Fixed

- Allowed canonical composer source and first-segment URLs to satisfy link-profile capability requirements across providers while preserving unrelated validation and provider-availability errors.

## [1.44.4] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Added the missing `packages/video-project/` workspace package to the Docker build context so the frontend can resolve `@openpost/video-project` during containerized builds.
- Added the Paraglide i18n Vite plugin to the marketing-site build so shared frontend components can resolve `$lib/paraglide/messages` at build time.

## [1.44.3] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Retried transient Cachix installation failures in CI and release workflows without disabling the shared Devenv cache.

## [1.44.2] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Allowed functional software WebGL2 rendering for Video Studio and aligned release browser tests with the current settings, calendar, and private-beta UI contracts.

## [1.44.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Updated the public post-preview browser test to follow the new accessible preview-options sheet on desktop and mobile.

## [1.44.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Added a dedicated instance-admin Users table with plan, access, activity, and content details, plus audited five-minute, one-use links for opening a non-admin user's session in a private browser window.
- Added a live month-and-year label to the rolling sidebar mini-calendar so its position stays clear while scrolling.
- Added OpenPost Video Studio: a local-first browser editor and recorder with a guided timeline, four social format variants, local captions and cleanup suggestions, crash recovery, incremental MP4/WebM export, optional cloud projects and checkpoints, stock photo/video search, and rendition-aware composer handoff.

### Changed

- Kept Video Studio private by default while hardening its strict project schema, bounded three-decoder WebGL2 preview, exact codec preflight, streamed source/model/export storage, resumable model downloads, recording manifests, workspace-only sync planning, brand-kit styles, and checked-in CC0 audio pack.
- Reused keyframe-aware WebCodecs decode sessions across sequential Video Studio frames, generated 720p proxies only for demanding sources, adapted playback quality without lowering paused frames, and moved export UX into a focused editor component.
- Shared attributed Pexels, Unsplash, and Pixabay photo search with the existing image Studio, including durable guest imports and local-project recovery.
- Reworked the desktop month calendar into a fixed six-week grid with compact post rows and a complete day drawer for dense dates.
- Rebuilt application and free-tool previews with richer destination data, destination-specific desktop and mobile website chrome, and full-page shells for posts, threads, images, videos, Stories, Reels, Shorts, photo posts, polls, cards, and documents across all ten supported platforms; moved optional free-tool controls into a drawer so the live preview stays full-size.
- Rewrote marketing, comparisons, free tools, user docs, platform guides, and app messages in plain language, and aligned them with the current posting, analytics, comments, inbox, Studio, and automation features.

### Fixed

- Prevented cancelled native save pickers from being mistaken for export failures, completed local VAD requests instead of leaving them busy, kept promoted recording files after manifest cleanup, recovered recordings only through verified decodable chunks, and treated narrow pointer-based desktops as the full compact editor.
- Replaced the oversized native sidebar mini-calendar scrollbar with a slimmer treatment and kept date numbers behind its sticky weekday header while scrolling.
- Kept the expanding text-and-thread editor free of an internal scrollbar while preserving the shared Textarea primitive.
- Let token-only standalone preview windows load without an authentication redirect while keeping preview content off the URL and inside the random same-origin channel.

## [1.43.2] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Restored hosted X publishing on PostgreSQL by making provider-cost reservation upserts unambiguous, and retried transient Threads error code 24 after container creation.

## [1.43.1] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Kept the public changelog browser gate aligned with the latest non-empty canonical changelog section instead of one past release note.

## [1.43.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Added an instance-admin overview with 30-day registration and publishing trends plus a paginated user directory.

### Changed

- Moved media retention into General settings and removed its single-control navigation page.
- Replaced the sidebar month calendar with a forward-only rolling planner that starts on the current week, disables earlier days, and loads more future weeks while scrolling.

## [1.42.3] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Restored the background-blending text-and-thread composer and media alt-text editors without abandoning the shared Textarea primitive, and preserved Studio's compact inline layer rename treatment.

## [1.42.2] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Kept the public changelog browser gate valid after release stamping, when version headings include their visible `v` prefix.

## [1.42.1] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Rebuilt the marketing desktop navigation with the shared Shadcn-svelte Navigation Menu while keeping the compact mobile navigation.

### Fixed

- Kept the public Studio start page mountable by initializing its shared file-input reference with the component's nullable binding contract.
- Prevented visually hidden shared file inputs from expanding page width in public Studio, Media, brand, and preview-tool upload flows.
- Made the public changelog browser check accept both active Unreleased entries and versioned sections after release stamping.

## [1.42.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Added repository checks that keep visible Svelte form controls on the shared Shadcn-svelte primitives and validate the canonical changelog structure in local, CI, and release gates.

### Changed

- Standardized visible inputs, text areas, selects, checkboxes, and sliders across the application, public Studio, marketing pages, and every free tool on the shared Shadcn-svelte control system.
- Made `CHANGELOG.md` the single source for the public changelog and GitHub release notes, with the production release script promoting `Unreleased` into the new version automatically.

## [1.41.3] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Replaced separate YouTube category and playlist search fields with searchable comboboxes, and moved the Studio desktop menus onto the shared shadcn-svelte Menubar.

### Fixed

- Resolved stale LinkedIn rendition profiles from the current media shape so image posts no longer inherit a text-only zero-media limit or reject supported settings, and let Studio object selection begin on the pasteboard.
- Tightened the desktop schedule dialog around its two-month calendar and made the time picker fill the calendar height with the shared styled scroll area.

## [1.28.0 to 1.41.2] - 2026-07-28

This section consolidates the changes shipped between `v1.28.0` and `v1.41.2` before release-time changelog stamping was automated. GitHub releases remain the per-tag record for that historical range.

### Added

- Added destination-aware post previews for all supported social networks, including a live, private preview window from each composer account menu and shared preview rendering in the free public tool.
- Added empty Studio paint layers that can be created above the current selection and used directly by pencil, bucket, or gradient tools.
- Added native OIDC login and organization SSO with PKCE, nonce and browser binding, explicit identity linking and JIT provisioning, action-bound step-up grants, managed onboarding, verified-domain discovery, provider assurance, token policy, RP/back-channel logout, encrypted provider secrets, audit events, break-glass access, and one-time Capacitor handoffs.

- Added a client-first video workflow across every video-capable composer and the Media library, with browser-side inspection, MP4 remuxing, H.264/AAC transcoding and compression, precise trimming, draggable aspect-ratio cropping, real upload progress and cancellation, durable server verification, poster generation, and retryable processing.
- Added a cloud-only X request-cost guardrail with durable pre-request reservations, immutable idempotent events only for confirmed successes, separate unresolved exposure, reconciled monthly counters, workspace-visible estimates, and per-workspace safety limits that never gate self-hosted publishing.
- Added a self-hosted instance-admin update status with running build details, cached and bounded stable release checks, validated official release links, and no auto-update path.
- Added LinkedIn Organization Page selection with one-grant multi-account connection, encrypted shared credentials, organization author URNs, and an explicit operator permission gate.
- Added verified Discord webhook accounts with scheduled text, streamed multipart attachments, safe mention defaults, reply references, and deletion.
- Added a durable Engagement workspace, per-user in-app notifications, and an opt-in unified inbox for X, Bluesky, Facebook Pages, Instagram Professional accounts, and Mastodon direct posts.
- Added durable account and publication analytics for X, Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, with adaptive background collection, explicit permission and support states, provider-specific metrics, history, and a responsive Analytics workspace.
- Added an installable `openpost-cli` agent skill with safe CLI workflows for setup, authoring, media, scheduling, publishing, recovery, and moderation.
- Added CLI commands for provider readiness and capabilities, reusable posting slots, media storage and usage, alt-text updates and deletion, and publication retry and deletion.
- Added reusable image and shape masks, drop and inner shadows, glow presets, curved text paths, and layer blend modes to Studio, with the same rendering in the canvas, saved previews, and exports.
- Added pixel-based rectangle, ellipse, lasso, and color-aware magic selections to Studio, plus persistent hard-edge Pencil and tolerance-aware Paint Bucket tools with selection clipping, brand colors, touch controls, and keyboard shortcuts.
- Added selection-clipped linear, radial, angle, reflected, and diamond gradients to Studio, plus reusable inside, center, and outside borders for visual layers.
- Added non-destructive Eraser and Magic Eraser tools, expanded image color controls and quick looks, and outside borders that follow the visible pixels of transparent images.
- Added transparent, solid, multi-stop gradient, and image page backgrounds to Studio, with opacity controls, responsive previews, and configurable JPEG matte colors.
- Added account-aware LinkedIn member and Organization Page analytics for approved Community Management API applications.
- Added a unified follower trend and publication-level content performance with expandable per-platform results.
- Added direct provider-post links to Engagement, including instance-aware Mastodon and DID-aware Bluesky links.
- Added actionable partial-publish notifications, a safe retry-all-failed-destinations action, token-free in-app workspace invitation acceptance, and X/Mastodon engagement reactions.

### Changed

- Rebuilt the marketing site around a shorter product-led homepage, task-first free tools, role-based pricing, clearer platform and comparison guides, and responsive tables that become readable phone layouts.
- Reused one transient saving and saved indicator across Studio and every composer.
- Made desktop scheduling show two adjacent months, moved engagement collection issues into a provider- and post-specific status menu, and reduced analytics native-post actions to compact external-link controls.
- Reduced app startup and publication-list load with precompressed immutable assets, service-worker caching that fills as routes are visited, video-editor code loaded only when needed, and publication data loaded in a fixed number of queries.
- Added Photoshop-style Studio tool slots, movable pixel-selection borders, textured pencil strokes, and drag-to-place media previews.
- Replaced the remaining native radio inputs with the shared shadcn-svelte radio group and synchronized Studio color editing across Hex, HSL, and RGB.
- Clarified analytics exposure metrics, made follower changes legible with a padded chart range, and kept long connected-account lists within the chart height on desktop.
- Standardized editable Settings pages on one sticky save footer, removed the redundant Brand kit name, and simplified account security with expandable password and data actions.
- Standardized checkbox controls on the shared shadcn-svelte component and moved Analytics trends to the shared shadcn-svelte chart stack.
- Described Instagram Business and Creator, Facebook Pages, TikTok, and YouTube as implemented integrations while keeping live-account verification separate from repository support.
- Added TTF and OTF brand-font uploads alongside WOFF2, simplified brand-asset editing, and reused Studio font and color selectors for brand text styles.
- Applied X text, video-duration, and video-size limits per connected account by reading the authenticated account's subscription tier, with standard limits used when the tier cannot be verified.
- Streamed large local and S3-compatible video uploads with bounded memory and multipart object writes so account-specific X video limits are reachable through the media library.
- Rebuilt Calendar and Activity from the canonical publication inventory, added month and week planning, workspace, platform, and status filters, published history, and scheduled-item rescheduling, and carried selected dates and times into every composer.
- Merged uploads and editable designs into one Media library, moved the workspace Brand kit into Settings, polished Media details with a stable thumbnail-led layout, and removed the product demo link from the profile menu.
- Kept the Settings navigation available while managing social accounts so moving between workspace settings no longer opens a disconnected page.
- Moved CLI and MCP text-post and publication mutations onto the current revision-aware authoring contract, kept linked publications and publish jobs synchronized, and reserved `--profile` for CLI profiles by naming content filters `--content-profile`.
- Reworked Studio around a media-first asset panel, brand-aware color and font pickers, custom sliders, richer shape and crop controls, transient save feedback, native range selection, inline layer naming, hierarchical groups, and contextual layer and design actions.
- Separated Studio object selection from pixel selections, grouped rectangle and ellipse selections, kept Lasso and Magic Select distinct, and split Pencil, fill, and eraser tools into clear groups.
- Moved Studio media selection into a full-height sheet and made media grids add columns as their panels grow.
- Renamed the sidebar Communications destination to Inbox, clarified archived engagement actions, and kept filter changes in place without replacing the page with a loading placeholder.
- Standardized application select controls on the shared shadcn-svelte component.
- Made Engagement post-centered with account/publication filters, reply threading, safe attachment links, edited/deleted state, and durable provider sync health.
- Kept destination customization and reset controls in the account menu, surfaced conflict resolution in the authoring flow, and replaced persistent composer status summaries with transient save feedback beside the destination selector.
- Made Analytics account filters apply to every total and content row, added per-provider metric detail, sorting, native links, stale timing, and capture-window snapshot deduplication.
- Made feedback rate limits durable across restarts and multiple app instances.

### Fixed

- Kept context-menu layer renaming open long enough to edit and submit the new name.
- Restored YouTube category and playlist choices in destination settings, populated native-post links from stored provider IDs and canonical permalinks, loaded persisted TTF brand fonts under their friendly names, and removed the stray Activity tab scrollbar.
- Kept the Studio canvas point beneath the mouse or pinch midpoint fixed while zooming, let pixel selections start or end beyond the image edge, shortened the rounded-shape label, and tightened desktop tool menus.
- Kept organization membership complete when workspace invitations are accepted and backfilled existing workspace members so organization policy, billing, and team views share the same membership boundary.
- Prevented signed-in startup redirects from briefly mounting the login form inside the authenticated application sidebar.
- Fixed Studio color picks falling back to black, first-drag layer movement and Alt duplication, unstable paint erasing, and save validation for erase masks and color adjustments.
- Persisted each Studio design's export format and quality so PNG and WebP selections no longer reset to the preset default after autosave.
- Kept desktop page widths stable when vertical scrollbars appear without narrowing phone drawers, shortened the draft context action, and made Engagement archive, restore, read, and provider-delete actions update without a loading flash or false “Move to inbox” state.
- Used the configured public media or S3/R2 URL consistently for verification and provider publishing, refreshed stale failed checks before validation, and removed duplicate HTTPS errors from destination account menus.
- Made Studio transforms undoable, made Shift-rotation snap stably to 15-degree steps, assigned Space-drag to panning and Alt-drag to duplication, and allowed pasteboard clicks to clear selection.
- Restored native Tab navigation in Studio, exposed shape insertion on desktop and mobile, and made export settings summarize output size, transparency, and destination before rendering.
- Kept the sidebar calendar and full Calendar on one canonical occurrence rule so scheduled and published items appear consistently.
- Loaded the original authenticated Brand asset when a generated thumbnail is unavailable.
- Gave the full frontend validation program enough bounded Node heap to complete the release gate.
- Aligned release browser checks with publication-backed Activity and Calendar loading, the current brand-font picker, and slower Studio export environments.
- Redirected marketing-site documentation paths to the canonical docs site and restored real 404 responses for unknown paths.
- Made Studio layer reordering work with touch drag handles on mobile, corrected one-direction drop placement, and kept keyboard reordering one step at a time.
- Preserved image aspect ratios when Studio media metadata arrives before or after insertion, made stretch the default image fit, and enlarged canvas resize handles for touch.
- Kept every grouped Studio child inside its group stacking slot during initial renders and later canvas syncs so unrelated circles, images, and other layers cannot render between grouped text and shapes.
- Added right-click and long-press actions to Media assets, editable designs, and sidebar drafts, including first-class design favorites and safe design deletion.
- Simplified the Media toolbar by combining counts with storage, removing duplicate status controls, reducing the layout switcher, and removing the doubled divider above Workspace navigation.
- Kept Android Studio text editing anchored above the keyboard without refitting the canvas or panning the document, and made long mobile Settings menus scroll within the visible viewport.
- Kept release artifact packaging on the pinned Node, pnpm, and Go toolchains after Devenv preflight so transient Nix store references cannot strand frontend, server, or CLI release assets.
- Kept Brand kit text fields and color controls mounted while their values change so keyboard focus, selection, and color-picker state no longer reset during editing.
- Kept resized Studio images flush with their frames by preserving source-pixel geometry during Fabric transforms, and kept canvas selection synchronized after document updates.
- Applied hidden and locked Studio group state to every descendant during incremental canvas updates, and recomputed cover/contain image geometry after frame aspect-ratio changes so the editor matches saved previews and exports.
- Kept the text-and-thread composer's compatibility draft in sync when normalized publications are created or edited through REST and MCP, including an upgrade backfill for existing publications.
- Kept MCP source-text updates synchronized with the linked text-and-thread editor row so agent edits reopen with the current content and revision.
- Routed uploads through the storage mode advertised by the server instead of probing an unsupported direct-upload endpoint, and raised the bounded frontend build heap to the verified bundle minimum.
- Preserved analytics and engagement continuity when OAuth accounts are reconnected, including historical renditions linked to duplicate inactive account rows.
- Removed content performance for posts that providers report as deleted or unavailable, while keeping the canonical OpenPost publication history.
- Removed generic provider quota caveats from the composer when there is no actionable account problem.
- Kept Studio export confirmation ahead of late autosave announcements and aligned end-to-end select interactions with the shared shadcn-svelte control.
- Removed the unused draft `force` request field so conflict overwrite always uses a current revision compare-and-set, and preserved engagement read/archive state across provider edits and deletions.
- Preserved X reaction state across provider syncs, exposed the inverse reaction action immediately, and enforced workspace-scoped token boundaries when accepting invitations.
- Kept direct video upload completion idempotent while analysis runs, and allowed later manual publication retries to report a fresh result without duplicating automatic-attempt alerts.

## [1.27.9] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Added a tested SemVer release calculator that maps Conventional Commit impact to patch, minor, and major versions.
- Added a Star History link and current-star entry point to the repository overview.
- Added release and versioning documentation, including the corrected version-line rationale and immutable-tag failure policy.
- Added an authenticated, operator-configured feedback form for bugs, ideas, and questions with explicit recipients, separately optional screenshot and diagnostics previews, strict privacy limits, durable delivery jobs, and a support fallback when disabled.
- Added stable per-destination publishing failure categories, safe provider codes and retry times, direct recovery actions, manual target retry, and partial-outcome details in Activity.
- Added OpenPost Studio with versioned multi-page designs, original starter templates, brand kits and WOFF2 fonts, mobile editing, autosave recovery, client-side background removal, camera capture, export, and composer return.
- Rebuilt Media around reusable assets, designs, templates, brand resources, collections, tags, provenance, richer filtering, and one shared Library/Upload/Camera/Create picker.
- Added normalized publication and rendition segments, provider-qualified output profiles, account capability resolution, scoped destination settings, and paginated account option searches.
- Added authenticated, account-specific publishing options so composer fields can load live provider data such as YouTube playlists and regional video categories.
- Added server-enforced `mcp:read` access for inspection-only agent connections, with mutation tools hidden and mutation attempts rejected at runtime.
- Rebuilt the public platform and comparison guides and added six in-browser tools for character counting, post previews, thread splitting, handle checks, LinkedIn formatting, and timezone-aware posting plans.
- Added email password recovery, authenticated password changes, account JSON exports, and permanent account deletion with billing, administration, shared-ownership, durable storage-cleanup, and re-authentication safeguards.
- Added versioned Terms of Service and Privacy Policy acceptance for hosted registration, with public legal pages and an operator support contact.
- Added Go and production-JavaScript vulnerability scans to CI and release preflight.
- Added database restore-drill tooling, hosted restore evidence, versioned media snapshots, and declarative daily backup and weekly restore verification for the hosted service.

### Changed

- Corrected the current stable line from `v1.1.22` to `v1.27.9` after replaying published release cohorts under SemVer. The previous code state maps to `v1.27.7`; the `v1.27.8` correction tag failed preflight before publication or deployment, so this release fixes forward. Historical tags remain unchanged.
- Simplified the README around product purpose, supported platforms, setup, automation, and maintained documentation, and removed duplicated or stale repository details.
- Consolidated CLI documentation in the maintained docs site and refreshed contributor, frontend, provider, upgrade, and release guidance against current code.
- Redesigned the mobile app shell and composer with a safe-area-aware More menu, compact post controls, circular rendition targets, and always-visible touch actions for media and thread editing.
- Made linked worktrees share the primary checkout's Go and pnpm caches, added a development doctor, installed pinned Chromium during setup, and made local browser suites use that reproducible runtime by default.
- Made every active composer save revision-aware and atomic across source content, thread parts, media, destinations, overrides, segments, and settings, with serialized autosave and explicit conflict recovery.
- Named the restored default authoring surface the text-and-thread composer to reflect its role as the fast path for Post and Thread.
- Simplified the Media hub and picker, replaced blank design cards with source previews, curated the starter templates, and rebuilt the mobile Brand editor.
- Kept one intent and capability model across composer flows while restoring the text-and-thread authoring surface.
- Stopped publishing Intel macOS CLI and MCP release binaries; macOS release assets now target Apple Silicon only.
- Moved destination-specific composer settings into account cog dialogs in the Publish to menu, with structured tag, category, and playlist controls for YouTube.
- Rewrote the landing, pricing, security, open-source, changelog, platform, comparison, and tools pages around current product behavior, and refreshed the canonical composer, accounts, media, and settings screenshots.
- Restored the OpenPost composer screenshot as the product-demo preview while keeping the recorded video behind the play action.
- Updated the project to Go 1.26.5 and current patched `x/image`, `x/net`, `x/text`, and `cookie` dependencies.
- Replaced broad provider maturity labels with implemented and preview statuses that state provider approval, quota, public-media, and live-account verification constraints.
- Added the recorded product demo to the public landing page, app profile menu, user docs, and repository overview.
- Consolidated account selection and per-account content customization into one icon-based composer menu across every post format.
- Simplified the calendar day drawer with shorter copy, tighter previews, and destination icons instead of platform names.
- Gave the public landing-page hero a warmer, shorter headline and removed the placeholder testimonial wall.

- Added mixed-media carousel publishing for Threads and aligned public-media constraints with the publishing modes supported by Threads, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.
- Collapsed the MCP model-facing catalog from 24 operation descriptors to four compact tools (`search`, guaranteed read-only `query`, mutation-only `execute`, and the scheduler widget), with on-demand schema discovery, server-enforced safety routing, and compatibility for cached direct operation calls.
- Pointed marketing self-hosting CTAs at the dedicated self-hosting docs and exposed user/developer docs links separately.
- Split the docs sidebar into user, self-hosting, and development navigation groups with cleaner section labels.
- Corrected stale CLI/config/provider/settings/production-readiness docs so the documented automation env vars, file-backed config behavior, provider-app management paths, MCP setup/tool lists, callback URL guidance, frontend route docs, README/platform lists, homepage/media/scheduling/thread wording, provider capability notes, binary install steps, and cloud-readiness status match the current codebase.

- Fixed the scheduling dialog so its title and actions remain reachable while scrolling on mobile browsers.
- Aligned the product platform declaration with the responsive web app and Capacitor Android wrapper already shipped from the shared frontend.
- Rebuilt Studio editing around stable in-place canvas updates, serialized autosaves, reliable inline text persistence, current previews, correct Back navigation, resizable desktop panels, and an inspector that stays within the viewport.
- Scoped sidebar planner hover states to the exact calendar link or draft row so unrelated icons keep their color and only the active draft reveals its delete action.
- Restored the Schedule split button so its side action schedules the next free slot, or submits the selected date and time when one is already set.
- Routed linked Post and Thread publications back to the text-and-thread composer, removed their duplicate sidebar entries, and added quick draft deletion from the draft list.

- Sent the YouTube synthetic-media disclosure selected in composer settings with the video upload metadata.
- Prevented YouTube accounts from being selected for text, thread, link, image, carousel, or Story posts; YouTube remains available for Shorts and video uploads.

- Enforced workspace-scoped token boundaries on post and calendar reads, and derived default calendar months and UTC bounds from each workspace timezone.
- Interpreted composer schedules, calendar grouping, drag-rescheduling, and date-filtered post queries in the active workspace timezone, including daylight-saving transitions and local-day UTC bounds.
- Separated onboarding and invitation recovery from creation and acceptance, and added portrait-calendar creation for empty dates in the displayed month.

- Opened an existing post on its actual destination rendition when every destination is customized, restoring provider-specific character limits and rendition-only media; media upload responses now include the persisted alt text and original filename.
- Unified new and persisted draft composing: the first autosave now establishes the draft URL, draft editing keeps the normal schedule/publish controls, deletion lives in the composer toolbar, and the sidebar brand becomes the contextual New post action away from an empty homepage.
- Unified every composer format under the same compact publishing toolbar, removed duplicate workspace controls, kept the authenticated app shell mounted during navigation, restored the collapsed-sidebar logo, and tightened the Social accounts layout.
- Kept the active Settings section visible in the mobile tab strip, removed repeated section headings, and made status notifications properly announced and dismissible.

- Added shared frontend provider-media capability rules with tested composer warnings, size-aware metadata hydration, and provider-limited video labels in the media library.
- Added optional deployment/provider context and a redacted last-100-line log tail to `openpost instance diagnostics` support snapshots.
- Added provider-specific troubleshooting docs and docs E2E coverage for OAuth, permission, media URL, and publishing failure paths.
- Added offset pagination metadata for background jobs, including Activity load-more UI, CLI `jobs list --offset`, backend regression tests, and Playwright coverage.
- Added offset pagination metadata for post lists, including CLI `post list --offset` and backend regression coverage.
- Added release artifacts for the `openpost-mcp` stdio proxy alongside the main `openpost` CLI, with both binaries stamped with the release tag version.
- Added file-backed env var support through `<VARIABLE>_FILE` for cloud secrets, provider JSON bootstrap config, legacy aliases, and deploy-managed secret files.
- Added `--with-mcp` support to the release installer so desktop MCP clients can install `openpost` and `openpost-mcp` together.

### Changed

- Split the original hosted address into dedicated application, documentation, and marketing domains.
- Enabled registrations on hosted instance.
- Updated all documentation links from the original short domain to the public documentation site.
- Added `marketing-site/`, a minimal Astro landing page.
- Moved docs and marketing site deployment from VPS/GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Pages.
- Moved the JavaScript workspace to pnpm workspaces with Turborepo orchestration across the web app, docs site, and marketing site.
- Tightened cloud-mode CORS defaults so hosted deployments allow only `OPENPOST_APP_URL` plus explicit extra origins, while self-hosted installs keep local development and Capacitor defaults.
- Clarified developer and configuration docs so database, jobs, and media storage descriptions distinguish SQLite/local self-host defaults from Postgres/S3 cloud deployments.
- Added concise MCP server instructions during initialization and made the ChatGPT Apps widget render standard `ui/notifications/tool-input` events as well as tool results.
- Split settings-page static data and DTO types into a route-local module, reducing the Svelte page script and removing a mutable `Map` derived value from the posting-schedule grid.

### Fixed

- Made background-job workspace scoping, publish-job cancellation, MCP scheduling cleanup, stale processing-job recovery, and schedule overview date aggregation use database-portable expressions for Postgres-backed cloud deployments.
- Rejected MCP `schedule_post` and `schedule_draft` requests with provider/media combinations that cannot publish, including inherited draft media.
- Rejected scheduled posts and threads with provider/media combinations that cannot publish, while still allowing incomplete drafts to autosave.
- Hardened user-supplied remote URL fetches for dynamic Mastodon registration and MCP media uploads with shared private-address validation and guarded dial-time checks.
- Normalized embedded database migrations for Postgres so cloud deployments do not execute SQLite-only `BLOB`, `DATETIME`, or boolean predicates.
- Made the frontend instance connection check use the database-backed readiness probe instead of accepting liveness-only health responses.
- Return service-unavailable billing API errors for missing Polar server configuration instead of classifying operator setup problems as bad client requests.
- Enforced cloud-mode runtime validation so hosted deployments must boot with Postgres and S3-compatible media storage instead of local SQLite/filesystem defaults.
- Made app Playwright E2E runs start a freshly built Go server by default instead of silently reusing stale local servers.
- Removed duplicate Huma route registration from the Go binary startup path so app E2E runs and production boot no longer panic on repeated operation IDs.
- Wrapped the docs API reference OpenAPI renderer in client-only rendering so VitePress builds no longer emit a nonfatal SSR TypeError.
- Fixed release CLI cross-compilation by keeping `GOOS` and `GOARCH` out of `devenv` shell evaluation and applying them only to the Go build commands.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-06-27

## [1.0.16] - 2026-06-23

- Build release frontend assets once on Ubuntu and reuse them for server binary packaging, avoiding the macOS runner's post-build Node/libuv abort.

## [1.0.15] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Run frontend unit tests from the devenv pre-push lint chain and trigger the Vitest pre-commit hook for frontend dependency/config changes.
- Pin `estree-walker` at the frontend root to the CommonJS-compatible version required by Rollup plugin utilities during the SvelteKit production build.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Pin `svelte-toolbelt` at the frontend root so `bits-ui` resolves the export required by the production build in CI.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Track the frontend Bun lockfile so CI and local hooks use the same formatter/build dependency graph.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Added the frontend production build to devenv-managed pre-commit and pre-push checks so Vite compiler failures are caught before release tags are pushed.
- Avoided optional-parameter syntax in the composer account loader to keep the Vite/PWA release build parser path happy.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Kept LinkedIn account icons clickable in the composer while moving the thread-reply warning to publish-time validation.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Scaffold for a new `cli/` Go module (`github.com/openpost/cli`) — a standalone HTTP client for a running OpenPost instance. Includes the config layer (XDG config dir, profile precedence, flag > env > file), the OS keyring token store with an explicit --insecure-storage fallback, a typed API client, a JSON/table output printer, an account-picker that resolves `--accounts x,x:@main,mastodon:server.example` to social_account IDs, a schedule parser that handles RFC3339 / absolute layouts / natural-language ("tomorrow 2pm", "in 3 hours", "next monday 9am") / `now` / `draft`, and Cobra-based `root` and `completion` commands. The CLI does not embed the server, does not open SQLite, and does not import `backend/internal/...`.
- First-class API tokens for the CLI and other long-lived automation clients. `api_tokens` table stores sha256-hashed opaque tokens with the format `op_cli_<8-hex-prefix>_<base64url-secret>`; the JWT web path is unchanged. New `Authenticator` interface and `CompositeService` (JWT → API token fallback) wrap the existing `*auth.Service`. Huma handlers now accept the interface; the Echo `JWTMiddleware` is preserved. `GET /api/v1/api-tokens`, `POST /api/v1/api-tokens`, and `DELETE /api/v1/api-tokens/{id}` let users manage tokens from web/CLI; the raw token is returned exactly once on create.
- `cli_auth_sessions` table for the device-flow authorization flow that will land in the next phase (RFC 8628-style). Both device code and user code are stored as sha256 hashes; only the plain user_code ever leaves the server. Migration 008 and 009 are idempotent and auto-applied on startup, matching the 007 pattern.
- CLI device-flow authorization endpoints under `/api/v1/cli/auth/`: `POST /start` (opens a session, returns device_code + user_code + verification_url, rate-limited per client IP), `POST /poll` (1 req/s minimum, slow-down + retry-after), `GET /session?user_code=…` (the web approval page), `POST /approve` (mints an `APIToken` via the existing apitokens service, raw token returned once), `POST /deny`. New `internal/services/cli_auth` package wraps the session lifecycle and `CleanupExpired`. The CLI never handles the user's password, TOTP, or passkey — the user approves in the web UI.
- `/cli/authorize` web page that gates on auth, fetches the pending session, and shows the client identity, requested scopes, and Approve/Deny buttons. Same-origin `?redirect=` support on `/login` so the page round-trips through login when needed. New shadcn-style `Badge` primitive used by the requested-scopes chips.
- CLI skeleton: `openpost auth login|status|logout`, `openpost auth token list|revoke`, `openpost instance add|list|use|remove`, `openpost workspace list|use|create`. Login flows through the device-flow endpoints (browser-open by default, `--device` for SSH/headless, `--with-token` for stdin paste, `--insecure-storage` to opt out of the OS keyring). Config lives in `~/.config/openpost/config.toml` (XDG-aware); tokens live in the OS keyring by default. `--json`, `--quiet`, `--yes`, `--no-color`, and shell completions for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, and `powershell` are wired in. The CLI does not embed the server, does not open SQLite, and does not import `backend/internal/...`.
- CLI account and media commands: `openpost account list|disconnect` and `openpost media upload|list`. The `--accounts` picker resolves platform aliases (`x`, `linkedin`, `x:@username`) and account IDs against the workspace's social accounts, with a friendly disambiguation hint when a platform has multiple accounts. Accountpicker has table-driven unit tests covering the empty / single / multiple-match paths.
- CLI posting commands: `openpost post create|list|view|update|delete` and `openpost thread create <file>`. `--schedule` accepts RFC3339, `now`, `draft`, or natural language (`tomorrow 2pm`, `in 3 hours`, `next monday 9am`) and resolves against the workspace's timezone with a friendly confirmation prompt for natural-language inputs. `--accounts` resolves platform aliases via the picker. `--media` accepts existing media IDs or local file paths (uploaded first). Thread files use front matter for metadata and `---` separators between posts; the splitter has table-driven tests for front-matter, embedded dashes, empty segments, and mixed CRLF/LF. `openpost jobs list` surfaces the server's job queue.
- Release artifacts and documentation for the CLI: GitHub releases now build `openpost-cli-*` binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows alongside the unchanged `openpost-server-*` artifacts; `scripts/install-cli.sh` installs the latest release binary with `curl | sh`; and new CLI docs cover installation, authentication, posting, and automation.
- Generated CLI reference docs from the Cobra command tree. `scripts/sync-docs-openapi.mjs` now copies the Huma OpenAPI spec and regenerates `docs-site/reference/cli.md`, so command usage and flags stay in sync with the implementation.
- CLI social set management via `openpost set list|create|rename|default|add|remove|delete`. `post create`, `post update`, and `thread create` now accept `--set <name-or-id>`; `post create` and `thread create` fall back to the workspace default social set when neither `--accounts` nor `--set` is provided.
- CLI posting commands now accept `--schedule next-slot` (also `next slot` or `slot`) to schedule at the next available server-side posting slot. When a social set is selected or inherited as the default, the CLI passes that set to the next-slot lookup.
- Docs-site now has a full CLI section for installation, authentication, posting/social sets, automation, and command reference, plus a dedicated Android app installation/build page.
- Settings UI for CLI devices and API tokens, including token creation, one-time raw token display, token prefix/last-used metadata, and revocation. CLI device-flow approvals and manually-created automation tokens now share one visible management surface.
- Account slug management in the web Accounts page, backed by persisted `social_accounts.slug` values and a new `PATCH /api/v1/accounts/{account_id}` endpoint.
- Pre-commit hooks for the `cli/` Go module: `cli-gofmt`, `cli-golangci-lint`, and `cli-go-test` mirror the existing `backend/` hooks via the same `devenv`-generated `pre-commit-config.json` and run only for changes under `cli/`. The CLI's gofmt and golangci-lint were not previously gated at commit time; they are now.

### Changed

- Moved thread draft state out of `posts.content` (where it lived as a `__openpost_thread__:` JSON blob) into a dedicated `thread_drafts` table. The composer now sends the encoded draft as a typed `thread_draft` field on the create/update POST/PATCH and reads it back from the same field on get. The blob-in-content path is preserved as a fallback for data that was saved before the migration. Migration 007 is idempotent and runs automatically on startup.
- Replaced the `WHERE payload LIKE '%<uuid>%'` job-cancellation query in `posts.go` with a `type = 'publish_post' AND json_extract(payload, '$.post_id') = ?` match, so cancelling one post's jobs can no longer accidentally cancel other jobs (e.g. `media_cleanup`, `refresh_token`) whose payload happened to contain the post ID as a substring. Added a regression test in `posts_cancellation_test.go`.
- Made OAuth callback redirects absolute: the `Location` header on error and success paths now uses the configured `OPENPOST_APP_URL` as the base, so the redirect works correctly behind subpath reverse proxies and non-root mounts.
- Aligned the Go config's `*_REDIRECT_URI` defaults with `.env.example`: when an env var is unset the value is now derived from `OPENPOST_APP_URL` (with `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` for Mastodon, matching the documented example).
- The Go binary now panics loudly at startup with a clear message if the embedded `index.html` is missing or empty. Previously a build that skipped the frontend step would silently serve a blank HTML page with HTTP 200.

### Removed

- Deleted the dead `frontend/messages/es.json` stub. Spanish was listed as a supported language in the docs and the ROADMAP, but the locale wasn't registered in Paraglide and the file only contained a single placeholder key. Both `frontend/README.md` and `ROADMAP.md` now reflect that Spanish is not yet shipped.
- Dropped `openpost account connect <platform>` from the CLI. Account connection is web-UI-only: provider credentials live on the server, the OAuth/Bluesky-app-password dance is server-side, and the CLI's only account-management surface is `list` and `disconnect`. The `account` cobra group has a `Long:` description pointing at `<instance>/accounts`, and `account list` against an empty workspace prints the URL to the web UI so the path stays discoverable. Unit tests cover the URL-construction and empty-state helpers.

### Fixed

- Fixed `GET /api/v1/posts` ordering so the Bun query builder treats `COALESCE(scheduled_at, created_at) DESC` as a SQL expression instead of parsing `created_at) DESC` as an invalid sort direction. This removes the `unsupported sort direction sort_dir="CREATED_AT) DESC"` backend log and preserves newest-first dashboard/post list ordering.
- CLI list/single-resource endpoints (`ListAccounts`, `ListMedia`, `ListPosts`, `ListJobs`, `GetWorkspaceSettings`, `CreatePost`, `GetPost`, `CreateAPIToken`) used to decode Huma responses into a `struct{ Body T }` envelope. Huma v2 flattens the `Body` field on the wire, so the decode failed with `cannot unmarshal array into Go value of type struct { Body … }` and the CLI silently lost media data on `media list` (decoding `null` into a nil slice, then rendering "no media uploaded"). All endpoints now decode the flat wire format directly. 8 new `httptest`-backed regression tests in `cli/internal/api/client_test.go` lock the format for the next refactor.
- Legacy Echo media routes (`/api/v1/media/upload`, `/api/v1/media/batch-upload`, `/api/v1/media/metadata`) only accepted JWT web sessions because they wired `middleware.JWTMiddleware(h.auth)`. CLI users got a 401 (`invalid or expired token`) on every upload. New `middleware.BearerMiddleware(Authenticator)` is the Echo-shaped counterpart of `AuthMiddleware` and accepts both JWT and `op_cli_…` tokens via the unified `CompositeService`. The three legacy routes now use it. The bare `"Bearer"` literal was lifted to a `bearerPrefix` const to satisfy `goconst` across all three middleware implementations. 4 new `httptest` tests in `backend/internal/api/middleware/auth_test.go` cover success, missing header, malformed header, and rejected-token paths.
- Fixed the account slug backend contract used by `openpost account rename`: social accounts now have migrated/backfilled slugs, list responses include `slug`, and duplicate active slugs are rejected per workspace.
- Fixed `POST /api/v1/sets` so the response includes the initial accounts supplied during creation, matching list/get/update responses and making CLI set summaries accurate.

### Changed

- Expanded the README launch messaging around the Typefully-like workflow, target users, support snapshot, and current limitations.
- Filled in the thin operator docs with a more complete quickstart, single-binary install guide, backup and restore process, provider support matrix, and stronger security guidance.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- Corrected Bluesky video service auth to use the user's PDS DID from the access JWT audience instead of assuming `bsky.social`.
- Corrected LinkedIn video status polling to percent-encode video URNs as Rest.li path variables.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- Media library deletion now allows media that is unused or only attached to already published posts, while still blocking media needed by draft, scheduled, publishing, or failed posts.

### Added

- Added a media library download action for saved images and videos.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- Corrected Bluesky video service auth to use the documented GET query endpoint, parse wrapped video job responses, and poll video jobs with the service token.
- Prevented LinkedIn video posts from sending image-only media overrides and waited for finalized videos to become available before creating the post.
- Allowed dropdown sub-menus to overflow the quick-settings menu surface so the language picker is not clipped in production builds.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Clarified the README and docs to reflect the actual provider-by-provider video implementation state instead of treating video support as universally absent.

### Fixed

- Corrected the launch TODO and public docs after auditing the current X, Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn, and Threads video code paths.
- Reduced repeated backend string literals called out by `golangci-lint` `goconst` checks so local Go linting passes again.
- Added a real Bluesky video embed path, MIME-aware Threads media publishing, and LinkedIn video upload finalization with required file sizes.
- Updated composer and social previews to render attached videos as videos and warn about provider-specific media limitations.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Refactored composer preview rendering so desktop and mobile previews share the same derived Svelte state model.
- Extended account-specific post variants to track media attachments independently from the synced post media.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale composer preview and textarea sizing when switching between synced and account-specific social media variants.
- Prevented media that is only attached to account-specific variants from being deleted as unused media.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Documentation page explaining why to self-host OpenPost, plus clearer provider/platform limitations coverage.
- Capacitor app asset generation and refreshed Android launcher/splash assets derived from the project brand icon.
- PWA manifest configuration for the frontend build.

### Changed

- Refreshed launch messaging across the README and docs site around the self-hosted Buffer/Hootsuite positioning, target users, and current product limitations.
- Android release builds now use the consolidated `build:capacitor` flow so frontend build, Capacitor sync, and mobile asset generation stay in one path.
- Asset sync now prepares the frontend logo source used by Capacitor asset generation.

### Fixed

- Stopped tracking the repository root `TODO.md` while ignoring the local file, so personal launch notes can remain in the working directory without showing up in git.
- Corrected Bluesky token expiry handling by deriving expiry times from the JWT on login and refresh, which keeps automatic refresh jobs scheduled correctly instead of relying on a hardcoded login window or stale timestamps.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Restored authenticated media rendering in the frontend by allowing media image requests to authorize with the current JWT and updating UI image URLs to include that access token.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Restored Mastodon OAuth validation and callback state handling so missing `server_name` requests fail cleanly and browser redirects can complete without requiring the callback query to repeat the server selection.
- Corrected workspace-scoped job listing to apply visibility filtering before `limit`, so non-admin users get full pages of jobs from accessible workspaces.
- Signed Threads media URLs now target the app media endpoint by media ID instead of the underlying file basename.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- Docker release builds now copy the repo `scripts/` directory so the frontend asset-sync step works in GitHub Actions and container releases complete successfully.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Account-level MFA with QR-based TOTP enrollment, passkey registration, and step-up login verification, plus settings UI for managing both methods.
- VitePress documentation site scaffold under `docs-site/`, including landing page, sidebar/navigation config, OpenPost-themed styling, and first-pass operator/contributor docs.
- Shared asset sync pipeline that copies canonical repo assets into frontend and docs public directories.
- GitHub Pages workflow for building and deploying the docs site.
- Token refresh job scheduling plus backend tests covering queued refresh execution and provider-specific refresh credentials.
- Dedicated account-connection success callback page for returning OAuth users to `/accounts`.
- Workspace migration scaffold for configurable draft gap minutes.
- Workspace setting for `draft_gap_minutes`, used by suggested queue times when a day's configured schedule slots are already occupied.

### Changed

- Settings now include account-security controls, while login can require a second factor when TOTP or passkeys are enabled.
- Optimized GitHub Actions CI by priming a shared Nix store cache before lint/test jobs, caching Go/lint/Bun dependencies, skipping unaffected backend/frontend jobs, and moving Go race tests off pull request runs.
- README reduced to a shorter front door that points detailed setup and operations content at the docs site.
- Docs site base-path handling now defaults to `/` for custom-domain hosting, with `OPENPOST_DOCS_BASE` available as an explicit override for repository-path deployments like `/openpost/`.
- README docs links now point at the custom docs domain `https://op.rgo.pt`.
- Docs now include a Nix module deployment page backed by a build-time sync of the production module from `rodrgds/nix-config`.
- Token refresh handling now declares platform capabilities explicitly, retries publish attempts on any supported expired account, and routes OAuth success redirects through the new callback screen.
- Workspace settings no longer auto-overwrite shared timezone and week-start values from the first browser locale that opens a workspace.
- Posting schedule settings now use a local-time weekly grid with per-day toggles and row-based time management instead of a flat UTC slot list.
- Suggested posting times now consider already scheduled posts and fall back to the configured minimum draft gap when a day has no unused schedule slots left.
- Weekly posting schedules now preserve the configured workspace-local time across DST changes instead of drifting by the current UTC offset.

### Fixed

- Mastodon accounts now persist their configured `instance_url` as the canonical provider key, avoiding publish/token-refresh mismatches after OAuth connection.
- The default Mastodon callback URI now matches the documented backend callback endpoint on `localhost:8080`.
- Mastodon server listings now avoid duplicate entries when adapters are registered with both UI labels and canonical instance-url keys.
