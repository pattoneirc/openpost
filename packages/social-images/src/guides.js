      "Compare Buffer, OpenPost, and Postiz against your publishing workflow, account needs, plan limits, and self-hosting costs.",
    answer:
      "Start with the work you need to finish. Buffer is worth comparing for scheduling and adapting drafts. OpenPost is worth evaluating when you want drafts, media editing, destination-specific versions, and automation together. Postiz is another option to compare if self-hosting matters. Test your actual accounts before choosing.",

      "Turn one verified product update into destination-specific social posts, with separate text, media, and calls to action.",
    answer:
      "Start with a concrete change, explain who it helps, and show the result. Keep one source draft, then adapt its length, opening, media, and call to action for each destination. OpenPost keeps those versions together. AI can help with a draft, and you choose the final words.",

      "Schedule one source idea across several platforms while checking account permissions, media rules, timezones, and partial failures.",
