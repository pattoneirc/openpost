# Dither Kit source

The ordered dithering and alpha falloff in `src/paint.ts` are adapted from
[`pixel.ts`, `dither-paint.ts`, and `gradient.tsx`](https://github.com/Boring-Software-Inc/dither-kit/tree/1e7faee9aa252e499651e6736ed65f7a07d9a6bd/registry/dither-kit).
The button interaction is adapted from `button.tsx` at that revision. OpenPost
uses a binary mask and a fixed ink tint so hover and press change density without
increasing color contrast. The
directional gradients and chart hover emphasis follow `gradient.tsx` and
`bar-canvas.tsx`; chart scales and data remain owned by OpenPost.

Dither Kit's root `package.json` declares MIT. That revision has no separate
license file or copyright notice. Attribution: Boring Software Inc., Dither Kit.

OpenPost renders the shared 4 by 4 Bayer thresholds as a native-resolution SVG
mask. Buttons use two fixed colors; other surfaces retain the adapted alpha falloff. Svelte, React, and the existing semantic component recipes own the
controls, chart data, focus, and interaction. No React, Motion, chart engine,
remote assets, or continuous rendering loop is required.

`scripts/style-star-history.mjs` uses the same Bayer thresholds and the
per-column alpha falloff from `dither-paint.ts` to fill the area under the
existing star-history curve. The SVG and PNG backgrounds stay transparent.

and [DitherKit](https://ditherkit.com/). Canvas UI's `DitheredObject` and
`RetroDither` Svelte wrappers and renderers were inspected. Its MIT + Commons
Clause license restricts redistribution of components and ports; no Canvas UI
code is included here. DitherKit's browser demo informed the pixel treatment;
no application code or artwork was copied. `dither-field.svelte` is OpenPost's
own geometric wave field, using the attributed Bayer thresholds above.
