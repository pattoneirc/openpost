# Extension screenshots

`youtube-localizer-745a10444f66.webp` is a cropped screenshot of YouTube Studio in Brave, showing YouTube Localizer’s injected Generate button beside the thumbnail of the public video [Programação Web, em ~4 horas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blA8L2Fzq9E). Captured on 2026-10-08.

The screenshot shows the real video and Studio interface. No account avatar, API keys or private videos are visible. No generation or Studio changes were made for this capture. The crop was encoded as WebP without changing its contents.

`x-timeline-blocker-08db3f799836.webp` shows the packaged X Timeline Blocker 0.1.1 running over OpenPost’s maintained `SocialPreviewPage` X preview, captured on 2026-10-08 in an isolated Chromium profile.

The extension’s unmodified content script hides the preview feed and inserts its real gate UI. The composer, navigation and sidebars remain visible. The capture harness supplies X’s timeline DOM identifiers so the extension can discover the preview feed. The timer and Browse timeline button are rendered by the extension.

This is OpenPost’s X preview with sample posts, not a live X account. No real profile, account data, API keys or paid requests were used. The screenshot was encoded as WebP without changing its contents.

Image filenames include a content hash because deployed assets use immutable caching. Keep the catalogue and asset manifest in sync when replacing a screenshot.
