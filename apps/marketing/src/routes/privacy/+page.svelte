		</aside>

		<h2>1. Who is responsible</h2>
		<p>
			The hosted OpenPost service at <a href="https://app.openpo.st">app.openpo.st</a>
			is operated by Rodrigo Dias in Porto, Portugal. For privacy requests, email
			<a href="mailto:openpost@rgo.pt">openpost@rgo.pt</a>. OpenPost is the data controller for
			account and service data described in this policy.
		</p>
		<p>
			A self-hosted OpenPost installation is controlled by its operator. This policy does not govern
			an independent self-hosted installation; contact that operator about its practices.
		</p>

		<h2>2. Data we process</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Account and workspace data:</strong> email address, display name, profile image, workspace
				and organization details, roles, invitations, and settings.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Post data:</strong> drafts, scheduled and published content, media, account versions,
				OpenPost Image Editor designs and saved versions, explicitly cloud-saved OpenPost Video Editor
				projects, templates, brand settings, prompts, schedules, post status, and job history.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Analytics data:</strong> account and content numbers for posts published through OpenPost,
				past results, update status, and safe platform error codes. This lets you inspect measured evidence
				and prepare a repurpose draft for review. Analytics records do not contain raw platform replies,
				remote media, access tokens, bot tokens, webhook secrets, or direct messages.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Product and website telemetry:</strong> persistent first-party browser analytics after
				permission, or limited personless cookieless events after cookie rejection; opaque signed-in user
				and workspace identifiers; product and service events; country for persistent browser events;
				release, route-template, status, and sanitized error facts. We discard raw client IP after approved
				enrichment. We do not send post content, media, request bodies, credentials, email addresses,
				names, usernames, query strings, or raw URLs as telemetry properties.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Brand font records:</strong> custom WOFF2, TTF, or OTF files, family and style details,
				and the account and time associated with the required font-license acknowledgement.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Connected-account data:</strong> social network, account ID, username, profile, supported
				features, X plan when relevant, granted access, and encrypted access or refresh tokens. OpenPost
				does not ask for your social-network password.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Security data:</strong> password hashes, session identifiers, passkey public-key material,
				TOTP settings, API token details, IP address, browser details, sign-in and token activity, and
				password-reset records. OpenPost never stores a readable account password.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Billing data:</strong> plan access, subscription, checkout, customer, transaction, and
				billing-status identifiers received from Paddle or the payment provider identified at checkout.
				OpenPost does not receive or store full payment-card details.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Support and service data:</strong> messages you send, service logs, errors, request timing,
				usage counters, and abuse-prevention signals.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>3. How we receive data</h2>
		<p>
			We receive data from you when you register, set up a workspace, upload content, connect a
			social network, buy a plan, or contact support. We also receive account and post data from the
			networks you connect, billing status from Paddle or the payment provider identified at
			checkout, and limited technical data when your browser or client uses the service.
		</p>
		<p>
			Camera access is requested only after you choose a camera action. A live preview stays in the
			browser and is not saved. A still photo is uploaded to the selected workspace only after you
			choose to use it. OpenPost Video Editor can optionally record a camera track; that recording
			and its local project stay in browser storage until you choose a cloud save, Media save, or
			post handoff.
		</p>

		<h2>4. Why we use data</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Provide, secure, and support accounts, workspaces, publishing, analytics, and automation.
			</li>
			<li>Send content to the social networks and accounts you select.</li>
			<li>Draft image alternative text when automatic captioning is enabled.</li>
			<li>Process subscriptions, enforce plan limits, and keep billing records.</li>
			<li>Detect abuse, investigate failures, and protect users and the service.</li>
			<li>Comply with law, enforce the Terms of Service, and resolve disputes.</li>
			<li>Improve the service using technical logs and error data.</li>
			<li>
				Understand acquisition, returning use, performance, and selected interactions through the
				browser analytics mode you choose.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For users in the European Economic Area, these uses rely on performing our contract with you,
			our legitimate interests in operating and securing the service, compliance with legal
			obligations, or consent where consent is required. You can withdraw consent without affecting
			earlier lawful processing.
		</p>

		<h2>5. When data is shared</h2>
		<p>We share data only as needed with:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Social networks you choose</strong>, such as X, Mastodon servers, Bluesky, LinkedIn,
				Meta services, TikTok, or YouTube, to connect accounts and perform requested publishing
				actions. Their terms and privacy policies then apply.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>An identity provider you choose</strong>, such as Google, when you use that provider
				to sign in or link an identity.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Hosting companies</strong> that run the app, database, media, email, network, analytics,
				and backups under their service terms.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>OpenRouter and selected AI model providers</strong>, when automatic image captioning
				is enabled, to process a 400-pixel JPEG thumbnail and up to 1,000 characters of the relevant
				draft or thread segment as untrusted context. OpenPost does not send the original image for
				this feature. Their service and privacy terms apply.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Paddle and prior payment providers</strong> for checkout, subscriptions, tax, billing
				records, refunds, fraud prevention, and customer portals. Paddle acts as Merchant of Record for
				orders it processes.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Stock-media services you search</strong> to return requested photo or video results and
				record provider-required selection or download events.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>The disclosed feedback recipient</strong> when you choose to send the in-app report, including
				its text, optional screenshot, and the diagnostics shown before submission.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Authorities or other parties</strong> when reasonably necessary to comply with law, protect
				rights and safety, investigate abuse, or complete a business reorganization.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			OpenPost does not sell personal data, build advertising profiles, or share personal data for
			cross-context behavioral advertising.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dated <a href={resolve('/trust')}>Hosted service trust register</a>
			names current data locations, service providers, user-directed recipients, international-transfer
			facts, and the human production-access boundary.
		</p>

		<h2>6. Google and YouTube API data</h2>
		<p>
			If you connect YouTube, OpenPost uses Google API data only to provide the connection,
			video-publishing, and channel or video analytics features you request. That use and transfer
			comply with the
			<a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy"
				>Google API Services User Data Policy</a
			>, including its Limited Use requirements. OpenPost does not use Google user data for ads,
			credit decisions, or unrelated profiling.
		</p>
		<p>
			OpenPost uses YouTube API Services. Google's handling of information is described in the
			<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can disconnect a YouTube account in OpenPost and revoke access from your
			<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">Google account permissions</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>7. Retention and deletion</h2>
		<p>
			The schedule below states who operates each Hosted service data category, why it is kept, its
			current duration, and the event that deletes it or ends its use. “No general age-based purge”
			means the database does not currently delete that category merely because it reached a fixed
			age. Authorization can still expire before a row is physically removed.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can download an account export or request permanent deletion from account settings.
			Deletion can be delayed when you must first transfer shared ownership, cancel active billing,
			or preserve the last required instance administrator. Primary account and personal workspace
			data are removed when deletion completes. The Hosted service makes daily database and media
			recovery copies in root-restricted operator storage. Routine database dumps and changed or
			deleted media versions are pruned by a daily job after they become more than 14 days old. A
			copy can therefore remain until the next daily run. Operator-created repair or incident
			snapshots follow a separate review and are kept only while needed for recovery, security,
			legal duties, fraud prevention, or enforcing legal rights. OpenPost does not add a separate
			application-level encryption layer to each backup artifact.

		<h2>8. Cookies and browser storage</h2>
		<p>
			The inventory below covers first-party cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB
			databases and object stores, Origin Private File System (OPFS) roots and patterns, and Cache
			Storage names used by the app, marketing site, and documentation site. An exact identifier is
			one fixed name. A prefix covers names with a generated suffix. The inventory was reviewed on {inventoryReviewedOn}.
		</p>
		<p>
			OpenPost Image Editor background removal runs in your browser with model and runtime files
			served by the OpenPost operator. Source pixels are not sent to a background-removal service. A
			result is uploaded to the selected workspace only when processing succeeds.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Hosted service, marketing site, and documentation site use PostHog EU Cloud for product,
			service, error, and website telemetry. Before you choose, OpenPost sends no optional browser
			telemetry. If you allow analytics cookies, first-party identity and sessions can continue
			across OpenPost sibling subdomains. PostHog derives country for those browser events before
			discarding the raw IP. If you choose cookie-free analytics under More options, OpenPost sends
			limited personless events with daily server-hashed identity and no geography. Decline turns
			optional browser analytics fully off. Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control force that full
			browser opt-out. The signed-in app and backend use opaque OpenPost identifiers for separately
			disclosed service telemetry; the browser choice does not disable authoritative backend
			outcomes. Autocapture, session replay, heatmaps, surveys, console capture, network timing and
			bodies, advertising profiles, and cross-site tracking are disabled. The privacy-enhanced
			YouTube player is loaded only when you open the product demo; YouTube may then process device
			and playback data.
		</p>
		<p>
			OpenPost Video Editor live previews, optional screen, camera, and audio recording, editing,
			transcription, voice detection, framing analysis, and export run in the browser. Model files
			are downloaded only after the user starts the related tool. Local project data, recordings,
			sources, and exports are uploaded only when the user chooses a cloud save, Media save, or post
			handoff.

		<h2>9. International transfers</h2>
		<p>
			Your selected social networks and some service providers may process data outside Portugal or
			the European Economic Area. When OpenPost controls a transfer and a safeguard is required, it
			must use an adequacy decision, contractual safeguards, or another lawful transfer method. The
			Hosted service trust register states the current provider-specific facts and any unresolved
			documentation gap. Publishing to a social network is also a transfer that you choose.
		</p>

		<h2>10. Your rights</h2>
		<p>
			Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, export, delete, restrict,
			or object to processing, and to withdraw consent. Use account settings for export and deletion
			or email <a href="mailto:openpost@rgo.pt">openpost@rgo.pt</a>. We may need to verify your
			identity before completing a request.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may also complain to your local data-protection authority. In Portugal, this is the
			<a href="https://www.cnpd.pt/">Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados (CNPD)</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>11. Security</h2>
		<p>
			OpenPost uses encrypted social account tokens, password hashing, secure session cookies,
			limited tool tokens that you can remove, access controls, TOTP, passkeys, request limits,
			backups, and checks for unsafe software packages. No internet service can guarantee full
			security. Report a suspected security flaw to
			<a href="mailto:openpost+security@rgo.pt">openpost+security@rgo.pt</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>12. Children</h2>
		<p>
			The hosted service is not directed to anyone under 18. Do not create an account if you are
			under 18.
		</p>

		<h2>13. Changes and contact</h2>
		<p>
			We may update this policy when the service or legal requirements change. Material changes will
			be announced in the service or by email when appropriate, and the policy version and effective
			date will change. Corrections to spelling, formatting, or links that do not change meaning
			keep the same version. Questions and requests can be sent to
			<a href="mailto:openpost@rgo.pt">openpost@rgo.pt</a>.
