# Cloudflare public edge plan

The public-surface operator owns the optional edge-selected Markdown rules for
marketing at `openpo.st` and documentation under `openpo.st/docs`. The explicit
`.md` files remain the primary interface. The composed public-site build
generates those files and never reads Cloudflare credentials or changes a zone.

## Repository contract

`deploy/cloudflare/edge-plan.json` records two owned zones. The canonical `openpo.st`
zone owns Markdown negotiation, transforms, response headers, and cache
variation for both public path namespaces. It also redirects the retired docs
hostname directly to `/docs`. The legacy `openpost.social` zone owns only
reviewed redirects to the matching marketing, documentation, application,
media, and telemetry destinations. The file
also records execution order, credential names, and Cloudflare Free limits.
`scripts/cloudflare-edge-plan.mjs` derives every eligible path from
`marketingRouteManifest` and `docsPageCatalog`. Run:

```sh
bun scripts/cloudflare-edge-plan.mjs render --output /tmp/openpost-edge-plan.json
```

Review the rendered digest, path sets, expressions, actions, origin-header
counts, and rule counts. The generator fails before any API request if a phase
exceeds 10 Free-plan Single Redirect, Transform, or Cache Rules, if a Pages
`_headers` file would exceed 100 rules, or if a rule expression exceeds 4,096
characters. Each public build also rejects a `_headers` line over 2,000
characters. The generated plan uses this Cloudflare execution order:

1. `http_request_dynamic_redirect` canonicalizes known routes and preserves the
   query string. On the legacy zone it redirects each hostname to its matching
   `openpo.st` hostname. Paths and queries stay intact, including canonical
   route redirects.
2. `http_request_transform` selects an explicit Markdown artifact only for a
   canonical `GET` or `HEAD` request with one case-folded `Accept` value equal
   to `text/markdown` after HTTP field-value parsing. Mixed, weighted, wildcard,
   parameterized, truncated, repeated, and internally spaced values do not
   qualify.
3. `http_request_cache_settings` enables `Vary` handling for `Accept` on every
   canonical `GET` and `HEAD` and uses the exact request value as the cache
   variant. It covers HTML requests as well as exact Markdown requests so the
   first cached representation cannot become a shared, non-varying entry.
   A four-hour edge TTL overrides origin revalidation so both variants produce
   repeatable Cloudflare cache hits without changing the browser TTL.
   Exact-value passthrough is required here: Cloudflare's media-type
   normalization removes parameters and quality weights, which would collapse
   rejected values such as `text/markdown; charset=utf-8` and
   `text/markdown;q=0.5` onto the accepted `text/markdown` cache variant.
4. `http_response_headers_transform` sets the selected response to
   `text/markdown; charset=utf-8` and returns `Vary: Accept` only when the
   rewritten origin response is successful and already identifies itself as
   Markdown. Missing artifacts and HTML error fallbacks keep their actual
   status and content type.

Cloudflare evaluates cache variance from the origin response. The public builds
therefore generate `Vary: Accept` for every catalogue-owned canonical HTML path
and the Markdown artifacts in the composed Pages `_headers` file. Composition
scopes marketing's root Markdown rule to the one-segment `/:name.md` placeholder
and its nested Markdown rules to marketing directories. Documentation keeps its
own `/docs/*.md` rule. The response transform keeps the selected client response
explicit; it does not replace the origin header required by the Cache Rule.

The exact catalogue membership leaves `.md` URLs, assets, `llms.txt`,
`llms-full.txt`, other machine resources, and unknown paths outside the rules.
Marketing and documentation canonical paths omit a trailing slash. Query strings
pass through redirects and path-only rewrites.

## Credentials

For inspection, create a temporary API token restricted to the `openpo.st` and
`openpost.social` zones with Dynamic URL Redirects Read, Zone Transform Rules
Read, and Cache Settings Read. The `docs` hostnames are part of their parent
zones and are not separately delegated Cloudflare zones. For apply or rollback,
replace those with the three matching Write permissions. Supply the token and
both exact zone IDs in the operator shell:

```sh
export OPENPOST_CLOUDFLARE_EDGE_API_TOKEN='...'
export OPENPOST_CLOUDFLARE_CANONICAL_ZONE_ID='...'
export OPENPOST_CLOUDFLARE_PUBLIC_ZONE_ID='...'
```

The operator verifies each zone ID with Cloudflare before reading or writing a
ruleset. `OPENPOST_CLOUDFLARE_CANONICAL_ZONE_ID` must report `openpo.st`, and
`OPENPOST_CLOUDFLARE_PUBLIC_ZONE_ID` must report `openpost.social`. A mismatch
stops the operation before any ruleset write.

For deployment proof, create a separate temporary API token restricted to the
owning account with only Cloudflare Pages Read. Copy the account ID from the
Cloudflare dashboard or `wrangler whoami`, then supply both only in the operator
shell:

```sh
export OPENPOST_CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_API_TOKEN='...'
export OPENPOST_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID='...'
```

Do not put these values in repository files, shell history, CI variables used
by ordinary builds, command arguments, or evidence. Revoke the temporary token
after the related inspection, apply, rollback, or proof operation. The commands
report logical resource names and environment variable names, never token,
zone-ID, or account-ID values.

## Inspect, prepare, and apply

Inspection performs only Rulesets API `GET` requests:

```sh
bun scripts/cloudflare-edge-plan.mjs inspect > /tmp/openpost-edge-inspection.json
```

Review every current and desired phase in both zones. Exit status `2` means an
unmanaged rule occupies a phase owned by this plan. Resolve that ownership
explicitly; prepare stops on every reported conflict.

Use a new, operator-owned evidence directory. Render the forward plan, then
prepare the operation from live state:

```sh
evidence_directory=/secure/operator-evidence/openpost-edge-YYYYMMDD
install -d -m 0700 "$evidence_directory"
bun scripts/cloudflare-edge-plan.mjs render \
  --output "$evidence_directory/forward-plan.json"
bun scripts/cloudflare-edge-plan.mjs prepare \
  --evidence "$evidence_directory"
```

Prepare performs only Rulesets API `GET` requests. It writes immutable
`before.json`, `rollback-plan.json`, and `prepared-operation.json` files. The
prepared-operation digest binds the forward plan, complete live snapshot, and
rollback digest. If an unmanaged rule shares an owned phase, prepare records the
inspection and stops without creating an operation that can be applied.

Review all four files and the exact repository revision. After the operator
explicitly authorizes both reported digests, apply the reviewed operation:

```sh
bun scripts/cloudflare-edge-plan.mjs apply \
  --file "$evidence_directory/prepared-operation.json" \
  --confirm-plan 'sha256:REVIEWED_FORWARD_DIGEST' \
  --confirm-preparation 'sha256:REVIEWED_PREPARATION_DIGEST'
```

Apply rejects a missing, modified, stale, or incompletely confirmed prepared
operation before writing. It re-reads all four phase entry points before the
first write and compares each changed phase again immediately before its
update. Any new rule or version stops the apply. It writes each phase's complete
mutable description and rule list. Stable rule refs make a newly prepared,
unchanged apply a no-op. It records `after.json` and checks that every phase now
matches the reviewed plan. If a later phase update or the final inspection
fails, it checks each applied phase before restoring it and records
`failure.json`. Recovery skips a phase that no longer matches the applied state
so it cannot overwrite concurrent operator work. Treat every skipped restore
or API error as an incident and use the captured evidence to reconcile the
current state before choosing a next step.

## Roll back

Read the complete rollback file before execution. Confirm its own digest, not
the forward-plan digest:

```sh
bun scripts/cloudflare-edge-plan.mjs rollback \
  --file /secure/operator-evidence/openpost-edge-YYYYMMDD/rollback-plan.json \
  --confirm 'sha256:REVIEWED_ROLLBACK_DIGEST'
```

The rollback file contains only phases that the prepared operation would
change. Before any write, the command checks that every phase still matches its
captured applied state. It checks each phase's version again immediately before
restoring it. Any later
operator change stops rollback instead of overwriting that work. If a phase did
not exist before apply, rollback restores an empty phase entry point. Inspect
again and retain the before, after, rollback, command output, and
exact repository revision in the private operator record.

## Public-site deployment

The `openpost-marketing` Pages project owns the whole public origin. Its Git
integration builds from the repository root with these settings:

| Pages project        | Build command                  | Output directory   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `openpost-marketing` | `bun run build -- public-site` | `dist/public-site` |

The build keeps the marketing and docs frameworks separate, then composes their
static outputs. It rejects a marketing `/docs` collision and writes one root
`_headers` and `_redirects` file. The old docs project is not a deployment
owner after cutover. Keep its last successful deployment available only for the
rollback window, with automatic production builds disabled.

## Explicit surface deployment proof

The public Pages project uses repository Git-backed delivery. Let that
integration build the reviewed `main` revision. Do not upload a second local
build over it. After the production deployment finishes, build the same composed
artifact locally and save the read-only Pages deployment list:

```sh
bun run build -- public-site
bunx wrangler pages deployment list --project-name openpost-marketing --environment production --json > /tmp/openpost-marketing-deployments.json

reviewed_revision="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
reviewed_source="${reviewed_revision:0:7}"
marketing_deployment_id="$(
  jq -r --arg source "$reviewed_source" \
    'map(select(.Source == $source))[0].Id' \
    /tmp/openpost-marketing-deployments.json
)"
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $OPENPOST_CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$OPENPOST_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/pages/projects/openpost-marketing/deployments/$marketing_deployment_id" \
  > /tmp/openpost-marketing-deployment.json
```

The list output contains only an abbreviated source reference. The deployment
detail responses are required because they include the full commit hash, clean
source state, branch, environment, and final deployment stage. Keep the API
token and all response files outside the repository.

Record a separate 24-hour AI Crawl Control observation with `observed_at`,
`window_start`, `window_end`, `window_hours: 24`, the `openpo.st` hostname, request and
response-status counts, the data source, method, next owner, and next review.
Cloudflare exposes the dashboard data through its
[GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/reference/graphql-api/).
Set `user_agent_matching_spoofable` to `true`,
`crawler_identity_proven` to `false`, and `release_kpi` to `false`. The window
timestamps must span exactly 24 hours, both host-count and response-status
totals must equal the request count, and `observed_at` cannot precede the window
end.

Then bind the reviewed revision to the composed deployment and live host:

```sh
bun scripts/public-deployment-proof.mjs prove \
  --revision "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --public-site-deployment /tmp/openpost-marketing-deployment.json \
  --ai-crawl-snapshot /secure/operator-evidence/ai-crawl-24h.json \
  --output /secure/operator-evidence/public-agent-surfaces.json
```

Run the command from the clean reviewed commit after the public-site build. It
rejects a different or modified local checkout and any deployment detail that
does not report the same full commit hash, a clean `main` source, production,
and a successful final stage. The command is read-only apart from its output
file. It proves every generated
Markdown page against the local build, immutable Pages deployment, and canonical
host. It also checks discovery files, the full corpus, representative HTML
alternates, HTML-only sitemaps, canonical redirects, query isolation, real 404s,
OpenAPI JSON, the native MCP boundary, and asset media types. Native checks
cover both OpenAPI documents, both RFC 9727 catalogs, both RFC 9728
protected-resource paths, the marketing and app MCP cards, ARD, the Agent
Skills index and archive, each crawler policy and Content Signal header, and
the marketing favicon. The report keeps
local build success, Pages artifact acceptance, live behavior, deployed source
revision, and the AI crawl observation as separate evidence.

## Live acceptance

Use Cloudflare Trace for the canonical marketing and documentation hosts and
all five former hostnames before enabling redirects and after apply. Confirm the legacy Single Redirect rules
preserve path and query, the canonical Single Redirect runs before URL Rewrite,
Cache Rules see the canonical request and `Accept`, and response-header
transformation occurs after cache configuration. Then check:

- canonical HTML `GET` and `HEAD` stay HTML for missing, mixed, weighted,
  wildcard, parameterized, repeated, or non-Markdown `Accept` values;
- exactly `Accept: text/markdown` selects the corresponding checked-in `.md`
  artifact without changing the visible canonical URL;
- trailing-slash redirects preserve query strings, and explicit `.md`, assets,
  machine resources, and unknown paths do not redirect or rewrite;
- every former hostname reaches its matching canonical host with one permanent
  redirect;
- first HTML and Markdown requests create separate cache entries, then repeated
  requests hit the matching representation without crossing content types.

Cloudflare Trace is the rule-order evidence. Response headers and repeated
requests are the cache-order evidence. Record both canonical content hosts, all
former hosts, `GET` and `HEAD`, one ordinary page, the root, and one documentation
section index.

Review Cloudflare AI Crawl Control within 24 hours of the first apply and within
24 hours of every later edge-plan or crawler-policy change. Record whether
verified AI crawlers receive the intended public access, whether any crawler is
blocked or allowed, and the next named owner and review time. AI Crawl Control
does not replace the route, representation, cache, or Trace checks above.
