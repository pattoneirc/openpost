# Environment Variables

This reference is for operators configuring an OpenPost instance.

This page summarizes the env vars used by the backend. Some values in `.env.example` are recommended deployment examples; code defaults may differ.

## File-backed values

Most variables loaded through the main backend config loader can also be loaded from `<VARIABLE>_FILE`. OpenPost checks the direct variable first, then its file variant, then any legacy aliases and their file variants. File contents are trimmed before use.

Adapter-only variables read directly by provider code, such as `META_GRAPH_API_VERSION`, do not currently support `_FILE` variants.

This is useful for Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, NixOS, and sops-managed secrets:

```sh
OPENPOST_JWT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/openpost-jwt-secret
OPENPOST_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/openpost-encryption-key
OPENPOST_DATABASE_URL_FILE=/run/secrets/openpost-database-url
```

Leave the direct variable unset when you want the file value to win.

## Admin-managed optional settings

Instance administrators can manage account policy, Paddle billing, authentication, email, OpenPost Image Editor, stock media, feedback, provider behavior, and provider-app settings in **Settings → Instance → Configuration**. OpenPost encrypts every database-backed value with `OPENPOST_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; secret values are write-only and the API only reports whether one exists.

For these administrator-managed values, except provider apps, configuration precedence is:

1. an encrypted administrator override in the database;
2. a direct environment variable or its `_FILE` variant;
3. the documented application default.

When an environment value already exists, the screen names its variable and clearly labels both a pending override and an active override. The environment value stays configured as the fallback but is not returned separately by the API. Database changes are validated and saved together, then take effect after the next server restart. Removing an administrator override returns the setting to its environment value or default after restart.

Bootstrap and data-plane settings stay deployment-only because OpenPost needs them before it can read the database: edition, port, database driver and DSN, public application origins and CORS, `OPENPOST_JWT_SECRET`, `OPENPOST_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and storage. Paddle billing values can come from either the deployment environment or the encrypted instance-admin registry; configure the complete required set before restarting a cloud instance. Provider apps keep their separate environment-first precedence, as described below. Adapter-only variables such as `META_GRAPH_API_VERSION` also remain deployment-only.

The official hosted policy URLs and versions come from `packages/legal-policy/src/manifest.json`. Run `bun scripts/legal-policy-manifest.mjs env` to print the four non-secret environment values. Cloud startup fails closed when the configured official URLs or versions drift from that manifest, so a policy change cannot silently record acceptance against old text. A substantive Terms or Privacy change advances its version and causes existing accounts to see the acceptance screen again. Spelling, formatting, and link-only corrections keep the existing version. The Refund Policy is incorporated into the Terms and does not have a separate acceptance record.

When an instance-owned Discord bot is configured, the worker keeps one Gateway connection open and publishes a rotating online presence that cycles through its activities every few seconds. With no stream URL, the activity is `Watching`. Set `OPENPOST_DISCORD_PRESENCE_STREAM_URL` to an HTTPS Twitch or YouTube URL only when the activity should be `Streaming`.

## Automatic image alt text

Automatic alt text is off when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is empty. When it is configured, adding an image with no saved alt text to the text-and-thread composer sends a 400px JPEG thumbnail from the server to OpenRouter. When present, OpenPost also sends up to 1,000 characters of the current relevant post or thread segment as untrusted context to help the model distinguish what the image means in that post. The model is instructed to treat this text as context, not as instructions. OpenPost restricts routing to eligible providers that declare they do not collect request data. Operators can also pin one exact provider and require OpenRouter's zero-data-retention classification. The result is saved as the media item's shared base alt text only if that field is still blank. The original image is not sent for this task. The Hosted service pins `azure/eu`, disables provider fallback, and requires ZDR; cloud startup fails closed if that boundary drifts.

This is external processing: the thumbnail and any relevant segment text leave the OpenPost instance and are handled by OpenRouter and the selected model provider. Review their current privacy and retention terms before enabling the feature. Existing or newly entered manual alt text always wins. With no key, OpenPost makes no caption request. A captioning failure does not stop users from attaching or publishing media.

## Meme maker

The meme maker is on by default. OpenPost embeds a pinned template catalog, validates template IDs and caption counts, renders each result in the backend, and saves the chosen image in the workspace Media library. Captions and replaceable workspace images do not leave the OpenPost instance. OpenPost saves an immutable recipe with captions, overlay media IDs, output format, catalog revision, and a safe template source link when one is available.

Manual browsing, caption editing, preview, and rendering need no outside service. AI suggestions also need `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: OpenPost sends the idea plus a bounded shortlist of template names and written semantic notes to the configured model, validates its structured response, and leaves every caption editable before rendering. It does not send template images, workspace media, the full catalog, or the original idea in the saved recipe.

The catalog comes from a pinned [Memegen source snapshot](https://github.com/jacebrowning/memegen). Its source links record provenance, not a license for every depicted work or character. Confirm that you can publish the template you choose. AI suggestions use the same OpenRouter privacy boundary as other configured AI features; keep the key empty if drafts must stay fully inside the instance.

## Update status

When enabled in `selfhost` mode, the Instance settings page lets an instance admin compare the running version and build revision with the latest stable OpenPost release. The server checks the fixed public GitHub release endpoint only when an admin requests this page. It sends no hostname, account data, content, or credentials.

Successful responses are cached for 24 hours. Failed checks retry after 15 minutes, use a three-second timeout, and keep the last successful result as stale. Responses are limited to 64 KiB and release links must point back to the official OpenPost GitHub repository. The feature never downloads or installs an update. See [Update Status](update-status.md) for the full boundary.

## Custom connectors

Self-hosted operators can load the custom connector registry from an absolute path with `OPENPOST_CONNECTORS_FILE`. The registry is read at startup. See [Custom Connectors](custom-connectors.md) for the file schema and security boundary.

## Provider app registry

OpenPost builds provider adapters at startup from active encrypted `provider_apps` database rows, legacy provider env vars, and optional `OPENPOST_PROVIDER_APPS` JSON. Environment-defined apps are authoritative over matching database rows.

`OPENPOST_DISABLED_PROVIDERS` is an emergency comma-, space-, or newline-separated deny-list of provider keys. It has priority over database runtime-control events and fails closed across connection, capability and schedule decisions, and queued worker writes after restart. Use append-only runtime-control events for normal operator changes and the environment list when the database control plane must not be trusted.

`OPENPOST_PROVIDER_CERTIFICATION_ENFORCED` is a cloud-only strict evidence gate and defaults to `false`. Enable it only after every enabled production subject has current runtime-control, approval, local-test, live-test, and OAuth-scope evidence. Production identity and public certification claims remain production-scoped when this flag is off; the flag only controls whether missing certification evidence blocks connection and publishing.

Database rows are intended for administrator-managed installs. They store `client_secret_encrypted` with the same `OPENPOST_ENCRYPTION_KEY` used for account tokens and act as fallbacks when no matching environment app exists. They require a server restart after changes. Matching is by provider, except Mastodon uses provider plus `instance_url`.

Instance admins can manage encrypted database rows through `GET /api/v1/admin/provider-apps`, `POST /api/v1/admin/provider-apps`, and `DELETE /api/v1/admin/provider-apps/{id}`. API responses never return client secrets; send `client_secret` only when creating a row or rotating the existing secret.

The backend exposes this registry through the instance-admin API and **Settings → Instance → Configuration → Provider apps**. Environment-defined apps appear as read-only. A matching database fallback stays visible and can be deleted while the environment app remains active. Admin-added client secrets are encrypted and never returned. Saves and deletes take effect after the next OpenPost server restart.

## Facebook

Facebook Pages publishing is configured through the provider app registry instead of legacy provider-specific env vars. Use `OPENPOST_PROVIDER_APPS` for bootstrap/self-hosting or the instance-admin provider app API for hosted/operator-managed credentials.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "provider": "facebook",
    "client_id": "your-meta-app-id",
    "client_secret": "your-meta-app-secret"
  }
]
```

If `redirect_uri` is omitted, OpenPost derives `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/accounts/facebook/callback` from `OPENPOST_APP_URL`. Facebook media publishing requires `OPENPOST_MEDIA_URL` or `OPENPOST_S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to point at public HTTPS media URLs.

## Instagram

Instagram professional publishing is configured through the provider app registry instead of legacy provider-specific env vars. Use `OPENPOST_PROVIDER_APPS` for bootstrap/self-hosting or the instance-admin provider app API for hosted/operator-managed credentials.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "provider": "instagram",
    "client_id": "your-meta-app-id",
    "client_secret": "your-meta-app-secret"
  }
]
```

If `redirect_uri` is omitted, OpenPost derives `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/accounts/instagram/callback` from `OPENPOST_APP_URL`. Instagram media publishing requires `OPENPOST_MEDIA_URL` or `OPENPOST_S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to point at public HTTPS media URLs.

## TikTok

TikTok is configured through the provider app registry instead of legacy provider-specific env vars. Use `OPENPOST_PROVIDER_APPS` for bootstrap/self-hosting or the instance-admin provider app API for hosted/operator-managed credentials.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "provider": "tiktok",
    "client_id": "your-client-key",
    "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
    "redirect_uri": "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/accounts/tiktok/callback"
  }
]
```

TikTok direct video publishing requires `OPENPOST_MEDIA_URL` or `OPENPOST_S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to point at public HTTPS media URLs.

| Variable                              | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

YouTube video uploads are configured through the provider app registry instead of legacy provider-specific env vars. Use `OPENPOST_PROVIDER_APPS` for bootstrap/self-hosting or the instance-admin provider app API for hosted/operator-managed credentials.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "provider": "youtube",
    "client_id": "your-google-oauth-client-id",
    "client_secret": "your-google-oauth-client-secret"
  }
]
```

If `redirect_uri` is omitted, OpenPost derives `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/accounts/youtube/callback` from `OPENPOST_APP_URL`. OpenPost uploads one video per YouTube rendition, uses private visibility by default, accepts explicit YouTube privacy and metadata settings, and derives fallback title and description text from the post or platform variant.

## Notes

- The preferred names above are what new deployments should use.
- `OPENPOST_PROVIDER_APPS` accepts provider metadata plus instance-owned secrets. OAuth apps use `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri`; Telegram uses `bot_token`, `bot_username`, and `webhook_secret`; Discord bot apps use `connection_mode: "bot"`, `client_id` (the application ID), `client_secret`, `bot_token`, and `redirect_uri`. Database-backed secrets are encrypted. Supported configured identities include `x`, `mastodon`, `linkedin`, `threads`, `facebook`, `instagram`, `tiktok`, `youtube`, `pinterest`, `telegram`, `googlebusiness`, and Discord bot mode. Bluesky credentials and Discord incoming webhooks remain user-owned connection modes.
- Backward-compatible aliases still work for existing installs: `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENPOST_DB_PATH`, `OPENPOST_FRONTEND_URL`, `OPENPOST_CORS_EXTRA_ORIGINS`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `TWITTER_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TWITTER_REDIRECT_URI`, and `LINKEDIN_DISABLE_THREAD_REPLIES`.
- File-backed aliases also work for existing installs, such as `DATABASE_URL_FILE`, `JWT_SECRET_FILE`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE`.
- The root `.env.example` is the best copy-paste starting point.
- Set explicit public URLs in production even when defaults exist.
- For Threads, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, treat `OPENPOST_MEDIA_URL` as mandatory unless S3/R2 public media URLs are configured.
