# Provider Troubleshooting

Use this page when a provider connection, OAuth callback, media upload, or scheduled publish fails. Start by capturing a support snapshot:

```bash
openpost instance diagnostics \
  --instance https://your-domain.com \
  --deployment docker-compose \
  --provider youtube \
  --logs-file ./openpost.log \
  --json
```

The report checks server health, setup, tokens, and the current workspace. It also includes the last 100 log lines with private data removed. It does not print full tokens or server secrets.

## First Checks

1. Inspect the provider's exact state in **Accounts**, with `openpost provider readiness`, or through `GET /api/v1/provider-readiness`.
2. Compare the callback URL in the provider console with the OpenPost callback URL exactly.
3. Confirm `OPENPOST_APP_URL` is the public HTTPS app origin.
4. For media providers that fetch files server-side, confirm `OPENPOST_MEDIA_URL` or `OPENPOST_S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is public HTTPS.
5. Open the failed post and read the error for each account.
6. Check logs around the callback or scheduled publish time.

## Common Symptoms

| Symptom                                | Likely cause                                                            | Fix                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provider shows `needs_configuration`   | Missing provider app config                                             | Add provider env vars, `OPENPOST_PROVIDER_APPS`, or save credentials through the instance-admin provider app API, then restart. |
| OAuth redirects to the wrong host      | `OPENPOST_APP_URL` or provider callback mismatch                        | Set one public HTTPS origin and update the provider console.                                                                    |
| OAuth succeeds but no account is saved | Provider returned no usable profile, page, channel, or business account | Confirm scopes, account ownership, and provider app review state.                                                               |
| Text publishes but media fails         | Media URL is private, local, or not HTTPS                               | Use public `OPENPOST_MEDIA_URL` or S3/R2 public media URLs.                                                                     |
| Scheduled post fails later             | Token expired, revoked, or provider rejected the payload                | Reconnect the account and retry with provider-compatible media.                                                                 |
| Provider returns permission errors     | App lacks product access, scopes, or review approval                    | Enable the product and request the listed scopes in the provider console.                                                       |

## What to do when one account fails

Activity shows each account on its own. A post can work on one account and fail on another.

| Failure                                                  | What OpenPost does                                                            | Next action                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invalid content, unsupported media, or duplicate content | Stops automatic retries for that account                                      | Edit the draft, then publish again                                        |
| Expired or revoked authentication                        | Stops automatic retries                                                       | Reconnect the account                                                     |
| Provider permission or billing restriction               | Stops automatic retries                                                       | Open the provider or billing settings                                     |
| Rate limit, network failure, or social network outage    | Waits longer between retries and uses the network's retry time when available | Wait, use **Retry account**, or retry all failed accounts from the notice |
| Unknown rejection                                        | Keeps a safe generic message and does not guess that retrying is safe         | Review the draft and provider status                                      |

OpenPost saves the error type, status, safe error code, next retry time, and the action you can take. It does not show full social network responses or account keys. A manual retry uses the same post job. It can retry one failed account or all failed accounts without posting again to accounts that already worked.

## X

- Connection requires OAuth 1.0a user authentication. OAuth 2-only apps will not work with the current adapter.
- Callback must match `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/accounts/x/callback` unless `X_REDIRECT_URI` overrides it.
- Media support needs OAuth 1.0a token + secret pairs. Reconnect old accounts if media uploads fail with an OAuth 1.0a reconnect message.
- Video is safest as one MP4 attachment and cannot be mixed with images.

## Mastodon

- Custom instances must be public HTTPS and must allow app registration.
- OpenPost rejects private, loopback, link-local, multicast, and local-address instance hosts.
- Preconfigured instances must preserve the exact `instance_url`; the persisted provider key is `mastodon:<instance_url>`.
- Video support is instance-dependent. MP4, MOV, and WebM are the safest formats.

## Bluesky

- Bluesky uses handle + app password, not OAuth.
- Use an app password, not the account's main password.
- Image posts support up to four images.
- Video posts require one MP4 video under 100MB. Video cannot be mixed with images.

## LinkedIn

- Callback must match `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/accounts/linkedin/callback` unless `LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI` overrides it.
- LinkedIn permissions and app review can block posts or comments even when OAuth succeeds.
- If thread child posts fail, set `LINKEDIN_DISABLE_THREAD_REPLIES=true` until the app has the required comment permissions.
- Video upload uses LinkedIn's Videos API and still needs live-account re-verification before broad production claims.

## Threads

- Threads requires the Meta app's Threads product and scopes: `threads_basic`, `threads_content_publish`, `threads_manage_replies`, `threads_manage_insights`, and `threads_location_tagging`.
- If location search asks for reconnection, reconnect the Threads account so its token includes `threads_location_tagging`. The Meta app must have access to that permission.
- Media URLs must be public HTTPS. Meta fetches media server-side and cannot use localhost, private DNS, or plain local paths.
- For local testing, expose both the app callback and `/media/...` paths through a tunnel.
- Threads posts support up to 20 JPEG, PNG, WebP, MP4, or MOV attachments, including mixed-media carousels.

## Facebook

- Facebook connects Pages, not personal profile timelines.
- `facebook account has no manageable pages` usually means the user has no eligible Pages, lacks full control of the Page, or the app lacks `business_management` or `pages_show_list`. Business Portfolio Pages require `business_management` for discovery.
- Page publishing requires `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement`, and `pages_manage_posts`, often with Meta app review.
- `Invalid Scopes: pages_read_user_content` (or `pages_manage_metadata`) during Facebook connect means the Meta app has not enabled that permission. OpenPost requests both: `pages_read_user_content` supports comment access, and Meta's Conversations API requires `pages_manage_metadata` to read Messenger conversations. Add both permissions to the app's use case, keep them in `Ready for testing` while in development mode, then reconnect the Facebook account.
- Single-media posts and Stories support one JPEG, PNG, WebP, MP4, or MOV file. Multi-photo posts support 2–10 JPEG, PNG, or WebP images. Every media URL must use public HTTPS.

## Instagram

- Instagram requires an Instagram Business or Creator account connected to a Facebook Page.
- Reading Instagram conversations requires a Meta app owned by a verified business, along with `instagram_basic`, `instagram_manage_messages`, and `pages_manage_metadata`.
- `facebook account has no connected instagram business accounts` means the authenticated Meta user has no eligible Page-backed Instagram account, lacks full control of the Page, or the app lacks required scopes. Business Portfolio Pages require `business_management` for discovery.
- Publishing requires `instagram_basic`, `instagram_content_publish`, Page scopes, and often Meta app review.
- `Invalid Scopes: pages_read_user_content` during Instagram connect is the same Meta dependency error as Facebook: `instagram_basic` depends on `pages_read_user_content`. Meta's Conversations API also requires `pages_manage_metadata` to read Instagram messages. Enable both on the Meta app alongside the Instagram and Page scopes above, then reconnect.
- Instagram does not publish text-only posts. Feed posts use one image, carousels use 2–10 JPEG, PNG, WebP, MP4, or MOV items, and Stories use one image or video. Reels use one video.

## TikTok

- TikTok requires Login Kit plus Content Posting API access.
- Required scopes are `user.info.basic`, `user.info.profile`, `video.publish`, and `video.upload`.
- The redirect URI in the TikTok app must match `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/accounts/tiktok/callback` or the configured `redirect_uri`.
- TikTok publishes one MP4 or MOV video, or a photo post with 1–35 JPEG or WebP images. Every media URL must use public HTTPS; text-only posts are not supported.

## YouTube

- Enable YouTube Data API v3 in the Google Cloud project.
- The OAuth app needs profile/email scopes plus `youtube.readonly`, `youtube.upload`, `youtube`, and `yt-analytics.readonly`. Comments, replies, and moderation also need `youtube.force-ssl`. Add it in Google Auth Platform, then reconnect the channel to update its grant.
- `google account has no YouTube channels` means the authenticated Google account has no eligible channel available to the OAuth app.
- `invalidTitle` usually means the first non-empty line of the post or YouTube variant is invalid for a video title.
- Uploads are private by default and support one video attachment in the current adapter.

## Escalation Checklist

Before filing an issue or escalating an operator incident, include:

- Output from `openpost instance diagnostics --provider <provider> --logs-file <path> --json`
- Provider name and account type being tested
- Deployment method and public app/media URLs
- Exact callback URL configured in the provider console
- Failed account error from the post, if the account connection succeeded
- Whether the same account can publish text-only content
