# Design System: OpenPost

## Overview

**Default authenticated app theme: Dither. Marketing keeps its original public palette with Dither texture. Recovery and documentation theme: Workshop.**

OpenPost is a focused working environment: every control has a clear job, related information stays aligned, and operational state is easy to scan. Organizations without saved theme settings start with Dither, using restrained orange-brown controls, warm paper or charcoal, Geist, and ordered pixel textures in both schemes. Saved organization and workspace choices take precedence. Marketing preserves its original green, blue, and lilac public palette, with the Dither texture applied as a restrained visual effect. Workshop remains the complete fallback and documentation reference.

The authenticated app stays compact and predictable. Marketing keeps its original spacious public layout, colorful authored panels, shared neutral controls, and sparse Dither texture. Documentation uses Fumadocs with separate Guides, Self-hosting, and API reference navigation, sharing the product palette, assets, and direct voice. Workshop provides equal light and dark expressions. Other families may support one or both schemes. When a family does not support the effective scheme, the complete Workshop scheme renders instead. Themes never mix token fragments.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Compact working layouts across theme families.
- Thin structural borders and tonal layers instead of decorative shadows.
- Each theme's focal color marks action and selection; semantic colors preserve status meaning.
- Compact app hierarchy with more spacious public and reading surfaces.
- Consistent page, loading, empty, notice, toast, and destructive patterns.

## Identity

The Converge symbol is the canonical OpenPost mark. Four equal rounded modules face one centered opening, expressing one workspace publishing outward. Preserve the exact supplied geometry: four-fold symmetry, even axis gaps, and a square footprint that remains legible at 16px. Do not redraw it as a pen, star, flower, window, or generic app grid.

Use the standalone mark when “OpenPost” is already written beside it or space is compact. Use the supplied outlined Manrope Semibold lockup for README, brand references, and static compositions that need the complete name. Transparent public marks use burnt orange `#B45309` on light backgrounds and peach-orange `#FD975D` on dark backgrounds. Public components use `ThemeImage` to follow the visitor's appearance choice; the authenticated app mark follows the active theme's `--action-focal` role. On Workshop Orange, use the reversed white lockup. “Your socials, on steroids.” is the approved brand headline; it is optional, never mandatory UI chrome.

README lockups keep the exact outlined wordmark and three solid Converge modules, while the bottom-left module dissolves outward and down-left through sparse square transparent gaps. The light and dark assets use the paired public mark colors; reversed and background-backed artwork keeps its existing treatment.

## Colors

The frontmatter tokens and values below define Workshop, the complete fallback and documentation reference. Warm neutrals carry most of that family; orange is a scarce product signal. Dither's app palette is defined in `apps/web/src/lib/themes/builtins/dither.ts`. Custom themes replace complete semantic roles rather than overriding isolated CSS values.

### Primary

- **Workshop Orange** (`#B74C05`; `primary`, `primary-dark-theme`): Primary actions, active destinations, focus accents, short identity lines, the Converge symbol, and selected navigation.

### Neutral

- **Warm Canvas** (`canvas`, `canvas-dark`): Page backgrounds and the base reading field.
- **Clean Surface** (`surface`, `surface-dark`): Cards, popovers, menus, and elevated tonal regions.
- **Carbon Ink** (`#302B28`; `ink`, `ink-dark`): Primary text and high-confidence icons.
- **Toolmark Gray** (`muted-ink`, `muted-ink-dark`): Supporting text, metadata, placeholders, and inactive navigation.
- **Hairline Warmth** (`border`, `border-dark`): Dividers, control boundaries, and low-contrast structure.
- **Failure Red** (`danger`, `danger-dark`): Destructive actions and genuine error state only.
- **Success Green** (`success-ink`, `success-ink-dark`): Confirmed success text and icons.

**The One Signal Rule.** In Workshop, orange marks the next action or current selection. It is not a background decoration and should remain visually scarce. Every theme assigns the same semantic jobs to its own action, focus, and selection roles.

**The Complete Scheme Rule.** A supported scheme is incomplete until its contrast, borders, hover state, focus state, reduced-motion behavior, and browser surfaces work together. A single-scheme family is valid, but its unsupported scheme must fall back to complete Workshop rather than improvise an inversion.

## Public surfaces

Marketing keeps its warm public canvas, protected identity, green, blue, and lilac authored sections, and original shared button colors in both schemes. Sparse Dither texture is an effect layer on the landing tour, authored panels, resources, and primary CTA surfaces. Texture does not replace the public palette or change button backgrounds and foregrounds.

The public palette lives in `apps/marketing/src/routes/layout.css`. Paired `marketing-lilac`, `marketing-mint`, and `marketing-blue` surface and ink tokens distinguish authored examples, editor panels, and the tour. `marketing-soft-ink` supports secondary display text; `marketing-section` separates neutral sections. Each role has a deliberate light and dark value. These tokens belong to public compositions and do not change organization themes or authenticated app chrome.

The landing page opens with a zoomable product tour using raw 2x screenshots, without the README frame or shadow. Later sections layer focused crops of actual editing, calendar, and analytics controls instead of repeating full app windows. Use colored panels and a tools-and-resources grid with concise copy. Keep trial terms and channel availability next to signup actions. Show only sourced testimonials. Label illustrative channel posts as examples and keep product-tour videos linked rather than embedded.

The shared marketing footer places a decorative ASCII OpenPost wordmark above the brand and link rows on mint. A paper-plane illustration overlaps the section above it. Keep link rows compact while preserving 44px coarse-pointer targets. Pointer movement changes the wordmark's characters; reduced motion keeps them still.

Feature artwork lives in `assets/brand/features/` for the README, public feature sections, and existing customer guides. Use large, recognizable feature silhouettes on transparent backgrounds, without a Converge frame or enclosing tile. Keep square dithering sparse so the silhouette reads at 24px. Colors draw from the green, orange, yellow, and blue badge palette, with enough contrast in both schemes. Application page titles, navigation, editor entry points, and controls use the theme icon system, without feature artwork. The Converge brand mark remains protected. Distribute public artwork through `scripts/asset-surfaces.ts`.

The screenshot tour distributes its selectors across the preview width, wrapping on mobile, with a filling underline for the active view. Advance every five seconds while visible; pause on hover or keyboard focus and provide an explicit pause/play control. Reduced motion disables autoplay. Essential copy, signup links, screenshots, the product-tour link, and FAQ answers remain available without JavaScript. Keep preview and zoom controls accessible by keyboard.

Documentation uses a quiet reading layout with a compact icon sidebar, persistent section navigation, and an optional table of contents. Guides lead with an action and keep body text to a readable measure. The homepage points straight to a first publication. Endpoint pages stay in the API section with generated examples and schemas. Workshop neutrals support both schemes; orange marks links, focus, and current navigation.

## Theme contract

Organization themes are versioned visual documents. They may control semantic colors, approved typography, density, spacing, shape, elevation, motion, shell recipes, component recipes, one complete icon pack, and decorative assets. They cannot change product structure, permissions, copy, data, provider truth, or protected identity.

- Components declare intent such as `focal`, `primary`, `ordinary`, `quiet`, `destructive`, or `link`. They do not choose a brand color or theme family.
- `chart1` through `chart5` are categorical data colors. Every supported scheme keeps all five chromatic and visibly distinct against its chart surfaces; neutral gray is reserved for the aggregated "other" series. Charts also expose labels or tooltips so color is never the only identifier.
- Published revisions and built-in versions are complete and immutable. Drafts may be incomplete while editing, but runtime output may not.
- Web and native consume the same resolved semantic contract through platform renderers. Neither client reconstructs organization defaults, workspace overrides, locks, revisions, or fallback.
- Workspace name, avatar, and color remain workspace identity. The Converge mark keeps its geometry and follows the active theme's focal color in the app. Provider marks, status meaning, media, and specialized editor glyphs retain their protected colors or geometry.
- Protected editor roles follow the active light or dark scheme. Protection preserves contrast, signal meaning, and authored output. It does not force dark chrome inside a light theme.
- Uploaded fonts are local static WOFF2 resources. The backend derives a validated TTF or OTF copy for native clients. Remote font and asset URLs are not theme values.
- Theme application is atomic. Fonts, icons, assets, and tokens are staged before one complete presentation replaces the prior workspace presentation.

## Typography

**Wordmark Font:** Manrope Variable Semibold (with Manrope, Geist, and system sans fallbacks)

**Workshop Display Font:** Geist Variable (with Geist and system sans fallbacks)

**Workshop Body Font:** Geist Variable (with Geist and system sans fallbacks)

**Label/Mono Font:** the platform UI monospace stack

**Character:** Manrope gives the protected OpenPost wordmark a clean, softly rounded shape that matches the Converge mark. Workshop uses Geist for compact product UI. Other families may select an approved local type recipe, while the app-scale hierarchy and readable measure stay fixed. Monospace is a functional accent for identifiers, timestamps, counts, tokens, handles, and queue data; it is not a general “technical” costume.

### Hierarchy

- **Wordmark** (`wordmark`): The fixed OpenPost brand name beside the Converge mark, set at Semibold with restrained negative tracking.
- **Display** (`display`): Public hero and major campaign headings, with strong contrast and tight tracking.
- **App title** (`app-title`): Authenticated route `h1` headings through the shared page header.
- **Body** (`body`): Controls, app copy, descriptions, and most supporting text; long prose should stay near 65–75 characters per line.
- **Metadata** (`metadata`): Compact operational values whose shape matters, including IDs, counts, timestamps, and status details.
- **Docs table** (`docs-table`): A slightly enlarged reading step for dense reference tables.

**The Task Scale Rule.** App headings stay at the shared application scale. Large display typography belongs to persuasive or reading surfaces, not routine settings and workflow pages.

**The Data Earns Mono Rule.** Use monospace only when character alignment or literal values improve comprehension.

## Layout

The app uses a centered content column up to 72rem with 1rem mobile gutters, 1.5rem tablet gutters, and 2rem large-screen gutters. Theme density may adjust bounded internal gaps, but it cannot remove safe gutters or change route structure. Shared page containers establish the route rhythm. Page headers switch from stacked to split action layout through a 44rem container query so they respond to available content width rather than the viewport alone.

Public pages use a wider 80rem frame and larger responsive section spacing. Documentation keeps a reading-first column and conventional sidebar. Mobile app navigation respects safe-area insets, keeps the primary compose action distinct, and leaves enough bottom clearance for content. Coarse-pointer controls have a minimum 44px target.

Use the established 4px spacing family, but vary it by hierarchy: tight within controls and metadata groups, moderate within sections, generous between major public-page ideas. Prefer `gap` for sibling relationships.

### OpenPost Image Editor

OpenPost Image Editor is an immersive, task-specific workspace inside OpenPost rather than a general design product. Its chrome uses the resolved semantic theme. The central pasteboard, page boundary, selection handles, transparency grid, and direct-manipulation glyphs use protected editor roles so authored work remains legible in every theme.

Desktop uses a compact menu bar, tool rail, asset pane, one active canvas, Layers and Properties panes, and an ordered page strip. Each persistent side or bottom pane has an accessible resize seam and a stable reset size. Phones use the same document model with a short top bar, a horizontal bottom tool rail, one contextual sheet at a time, a full-height Layers sheet, and a collapsible page strip. Coarse-pointer actions remain at least 44px. Two-finger input pans or zooms the canvas; one-finger input transforms the selected layer.

Each tool family uses one rail button with an internal corner indicator. A click activates the remembered variant; clicking the active tool, right-clicking, or pressing ArrowDown or ArrowRight opens its attached menu. Do not add a separate narrow chevron target beside the rail. Expanded pages occupy the ordered thumbnail strip; collapsed pages use its compact status row. Tool options stay in one scrollable row, with essential actions first, so wrapping controls cannot expand across the artwork. The narrow-screen More menu uses the same command registry as desktop menus. Color keeps a live canvas above its non-modal control dock on phones. Desktop Color uses a compact Layers pane so grading controls receive the available height; Edit and Color retain separate pane sizes.

The DOM-based Layers tree and Properties controls are the accessible equivalents of direct canvas editing. Every persistent change runs through the command system, exposes undo and redo, and announces saves, conflicts, exports, uploads, camera state, and background-removal state. OpenPost Image Editor uses a scoped theme runtime; it does not copy another editor's CSS, generated utilities, or trade dress.

### OpenPost Video Editor

OpenPost Video Editor uses a four-zone editing model: compact project controls at the top, a fixed tool rail with one full-height content pane on the left, one dominant preview in the center, and selection-specific inspector tabs on the right. The timeline begins beside the left content pane and owns playback position; its ruler is the seek control, so a second progress slider must not compete with it. Each persistent side or bottom pane has an accessible resize seam and a stable reset size. Semantic selection and focal roles mark the active family, property tab, playhead, and Export action. Waveforms, timeline state, canvas bounds, and media keep protected editor roles.

Keep inspector settings contextual. Selection exposes Properties, Animation, Effects, and Transcript only where applicable. Properties leads with content, geometry, and audio gain; anchor, appearance, crop, playback, pitch, and advanced audio settings use named disclosures. Mark modified appearance, crop, and playback groups so their state remains visible when closed. Scene detection belongs in selected-clip actions. Phones replace both side panels with one bottom tool dock and one contextual sheet while preserving the same timeline and project document. Quick Cut remains the explicit stream-copy path and Full Editor remains the composed edit path.

Video Editor property diamonds add or remove a key at the playhead. Fill the diamond only at an authored key, and keep animated properties accented between keys. Auto-key is a separate mode. Capture values before expressions and additive motion, in the property lane's units; inspectors display the current animated value and edit through the timeline actions.

Color gives its viewer and one active grading palette priority. Primaries, Curves, Qualifier, Windows, LUT, and Effects share the same named Clip or Sequence target. Keyframes replaces the active palette until closed. Scopes are optional; specialized effect filters only change which controls are shown. Keep comparison and auto-key controls available across palettes. Compact controls must remain complete at laptop sizes, with secondary settings disclosed or internally scrollable. Palette, scopes and Keyframes visibility persist per device as view state, never authored project data. Hidden scopes stop sampling; explicit color picking and Auto Balance can still capture a frame.

Playback stays direct in the preview bar; frame capture and in/out commands live in its always-available actions menu. Transcript setup leads with language and the captions action, keeps download size visible, and discloses engine settings and model storage. Existing transcripts keep generation setup collapsed; running jobs and errors stay visible. Canvas format presets change dimensions together through the existing undo owner, preserving frame rate and authored layer geometry.

Selected-object inspectors lead with the editable content. Text starts with words and font, while geometry and advanced settings follow. Corner pin stays closed unless active. Motion puts selected-layer controls before composition setup and applied animation before preset browsing. Text styles can apply to the selected text without inserting another item; the browser must show which operation its controls perform.

Shader backgrounds and image or logo effects use the existing searchable galleries. Tiles pair rendered thumbnails with short names and representative sample artwork. Gallery preview settings stay separate from authored defaults. Reuse shared inspector controls and show only settings relevant to the selected shader. Animated families follow sequence time, with speed and starting phase controls; zero speed holds a still frame. Static families omit motion controls.

Keep editor copy quiet. Use short labels, values, and direct actions in the default workspace; do not repeat the active tool as a panel heading or add routine reassurance below self-explanatory controls. Reserve inline prose for errors, permissions, destructive consequences, required attribution, and limitations that change what the creator can do. Put optional technical detail in a tooltip or disclosure.

Editor panes must shrink within the window and scroll their own content. On phones, Assets uses the full area above the timeline; Program restores the preview. Timeline marker details, mixer, and beat controls share a bounded scrolling area that leaves the tracks and overview reachable.

Fade handles appear only on selected, editable clips. New generated captions and imported subtitles start above video in compact rows. Track names expose a drag grip; reordering previews locally, commits once on drop, and cancels with Escape. Keyboard reordering remains available.

Video clips retain embedded audio by default. Detach audio in the clip menu creates a linked audio row and silences the video's embedded audio. Link and unlink control editing together, independently of which clip plays the sound. Recordings keep microphone audio with the camera, or with the screen when the camera is off.

The timeline uses a hybrid track model. The ordered primary sequence and project-wide markers remain semantic rails. Visual, audio, and caption rows render from the document's actual track arrays, so multiple tracks stay distinct and empty categories do not consume permanent lanes. Items on one track cannot overlap unless an explicit transition owns the shared interval; use another track for intentional compositing.

## Elevation & Depth

Workshop is flat by default. Its surfaces separate through warm tonal changes, hairline borders, and restrained rings. Other families may select a bounded elevation recipe, but resting hierarchy must remain clear and temporary layers must remain distinguishable.

Modal backdrops darken the page in both schemes. Keep the scrim independent of text colors so dark mode never turns it white.

### Shadow Vocabulary

- **Focal action:** a small, low-blur shadow that keeps a floating or circular primary action legible over content.
- **Temporary layer:** a restrained menu or dialog shadow paired with a clear border.

**The Legible Depth Rule.** A resting surface proves its hierarchy through a coherent combination of tone, border, spacing, or elevation. Themes must not stack unrelated depth cues or let decoration obscure focus and state.

## Shapes

Workshop uses a 12px base corner, 10px controls, 12px cards, and 14–16px prominent media. Theme recipes may vary bounded control and container shapes while keeping hit targets and state legible. Pills and full circles remain intentional shapes for compact controls, statuses, avatars, and focal actions, not a universal card treatment.

## Components

### Dither material

Dither pairs orange-brown actions at hue 45 with warm paper or charcoal at neutral hue 50, Geist, and outlined navigation. Use `oklch(0.4 0.13 45)` for light focal actions and `oklch(0.76 0.14 45)` for dark focal actions. Broad backgrounds remain neutral. Dither Moss uses green actions, warm neutrals, DM Sans, and tonal navigation. Both support light and dark appearance within OpenPost's compact layout.

Ordered Bayer textures sit behind button labels, along card bottoms, inside chart bars, and over shared skeletons and progress fills. Text, focus rings, and chart value boundaries stay solid. Charts retain semantic series colors, labels, and keyboard interaction. Forced-colors mode removes visible decoration. Native clients use the same palette and shape tokens with solid fills.

Shared empty states place an original static SVG wave field in a 120px by 64px symbol area behind a solid 40px icon tile. The field is decorative and hidden from assistive technology. Progress meters use the theme's small corner radius, while loading previews use the real Skeleton and ProgressMeter components. Existing reduced-motion behavior stays intact.

`@openpost/dither` owns the Bayer thresholds, native-resolution SVG masks, and DOM lifecycle for Svelte and React. Every surface uses 2 CSS pixel cells. Buttons raise density and opacity on hover, keyboard focus, and press; animation stops when settled and snaps with reduced motion. Preserve the Dither Kit source attribution in the package `NOTICE.md`. Marketing panels and the documentation app link share this renderer while retaining their palettes.

Dither buttons ease their pixel gradient on hover, keyboard focus, and press. Chart inspection emphasizes the selected day while preserving solid value boundaries and readable series labels. Tooltips stay within the visible chart viewport and dismiss with Escape. Motion uses the shared theme timings and reduced-motion rules.

The theme editor offers a coordinated Dither accent hue for both schemes, plus color pickers beside the CSS values for individual tokens. The hue control retains the palette's lightness, neutral surfaces, status colors, and distinct chart series. Color pickers preserve each token's existing opacity, and swatches display it. Edit opacity directly in the adjacent CSS value. Changes use the existing draft, undo, publish, and assignment flow. The Dither gradient component supports horizontal and vertical fades, with an optional second color.

Custom Dither button recipes must preserve text contrast after the texture is composited in every interaction state. Theme previews block interaction with `inert` so sample controls retain their normal appearance.

### Buttons

- **Shape:** Compact medium corners with a 36px desktop height and 44px coarse-pointer target.
- **Focal:** The strongest theme action treatment, used for one clear next action in a local group.
- **Primary / Ordinary / Quiet:** Decrease emphasis without changing the action's meaning. A neutral ordinary action must remain distinct from a focal action.
- **Hover / Focus:** Use the theme's complete state recipe, retain a visible semantic focus ring, and keep motion compatible with reduced-motion preferences.
- **Secondary / Outline / Ghost:** Use tonal fill, a full hairline border, or hover-only fill according to hierarchy. Destructive buttons use a quiet red tint until interaction.

### Chips

- **Style:** Compact medium corners, secondary tonal fill, full border only when needed for separation, and short labels.
- **State:** Selected chips use semantic foreground contrast and a meaningful state change rather than color alone.

### Cards / Containers

- **Corner Style:** Gently rounded large corners.
- **Background:** Clean Surface over Warm Canvas.
- **Shadow Strategy:** Flat at rest; use a subtle full ring or border for structure.
- **Internal Padding:** Usually 12–16px, increasing only when the content hierarchy needs it.

### Inputs / Fields

- **Style:** 36px standard height, medium corners, full input border, and a faint tonal fill.
- **Focus:** Semantic border plus a visible 2px ring.
- **Error / Disabled:** Error uses Failure Red border and ring; disabled controls retain legible text while clearly reducing emphasis.
- **Implementation:** Use the shared Shadcn-svelte `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`/`AppSelect`, `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, `Slider`, and related primitives in the app, public OpenPost Image Editor, and marketing tools. Native controls belong only inside those shared implementations.
- **Authored colors:** Use the shared brand-aware `ColorPicker` for hex, RGB, and HSL color values. Keep canvas sampling, grading wheels, CSS color expressions, and provider-defined color categories in their specialized controls.
- **Embedded editors:** When a parent surface owns the complete boundary, the shared `Textarea` may use `unstyled` so default field chrome does not leak into the editor. The text-and-thread composer and media alt-text overlay are intentional examples; ordinary forms keep the default treatment.

### Navigation

Desktop sidebars, public top navigation, and mobile bottom navigation share compact labels and a clear active state. Active app navigation uses the theme's selected recipe; public navigation stays quiet until hover. Mobile labels remain readable without horizontal overflow, and menus must render above drawers and sheets.

The marketing desktop header uses the shared Shadcn-svelte `NavigationMenu` for direct links and grouped resources. Its mobile header stays a compact disclosure menu with 44px targets rather than forcing desktop flyouts into a phone viewport.

### Shared Page Chrome

Authenticated routes use `PageContainer`, `PageHeader`, `SectionHeader`, and content-shaped `PageLoading` recipes. Empty, notice, toast, error, and destructive-confirmation states use the shared primitives so hierarchy and feedback do not drift between routes.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** reuse semantic theme variables and verify every change in light and dark.
- **Do** keep Workshop orange, or another theme's focal treatment, rare enough that the next action remains obvious.
- **Do** use shared page and feedback primitives before creating route-specific chrome.
- **Do** preserve touch targets, safe areas, responsive overflow, keyboard focus, and reduced-motion behavior.
- **Do** keep provider state and operational outcomes compact but explicit.

### Don't:

- **Don't** turn routine app pages into spacious marketing compositions.
- **Don't** use gradient text, glow-heavy dark UI, decorative glass panels, decorative charts, or generic card grids. A theme may use a declared material effect only when it serves its chosen world and preserves contrast.
- **Don't** wrap every group in another card or nest cards when spacing and a divider would express the hierarchy.
- **Don't** use monospace, uppercase, badges, or a theme's focal color as decoration.
- **Don't** create one-off loading, empty, success, error, or destructive patterns when a shared primitive exists.

Documentation uses neutral white and charcoal reading surfaces with muted blue links. Orange stays in the product mark.

App page titles use the theme’s typeface, weight, and tracking with `data-app-title`, capped at 1.25rem and a 1.4 line height. List and Calendar share the Publications header. Public profiles use the viewer’s saved Workspace theme after direct navigation or reload, and Dither for anonymous visits. Activity intensity derives from the active primary color.
